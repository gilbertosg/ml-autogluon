2480,Homer Kelley's Golfing Machine: The Curious Quest That Solved Golf,Scott Gummer,Baseball (Books),Sports,3.863501301,4,1,Paperback,2010,May,"The remarkable true story of a lone genius whose quest to unlock the science behind the perfect swing changed golf forever

In 1939, Homer Kelley played golf for the first time and scored 116. Frustrated, he did not play again for six months; when he did he carded a 77. Determined to understand why he was able to shave nearly 40 strokes off his score, Kelley spent three decades of trial and error to unlock the answer and to recapture that one wonderful day when golf was easy and enjoyable. In 1969, Kelley self- published his findings in The Golfing Machine: The Computer Age Approach to Golfing Perfection.

The bestselling instruction books of the day required golfers to conform their swings to the author's ideals, but Homer Kelley configured swings to fit every golfer. He found an enthusiastic disciple in a Seattle teaching pro named Ben Doyle, who in turn found an eager student in 13-year-old prodigy Bobby Clampett. Clampett's initial success in amateur golf shined a bright spotlight on Homer Kelley and The Golfing Machine, but when the young star suffered a painfully public collapse and faltered as a pro, critics were quick to blast Kelley and his complex and controversial ideas. With exclusive access to Homer Kelley's archives, author Scott Gummer paints a fascinating picture of the man behind the machine, the ultimate outsider who changed the game once and for all of us."

Watch Andy Field's introductory video to Discovering Statistics Using R
Keeping the uniquely humorous and self-deprecating style that has made students across the world fall in love with Andy Field's books, Discovering Statistics Using R takes students on a journey of statistical discovery using R, a free, flexible and dynamically changing software tool for data analysis that is becoming increasingly popular across the social and behavioural sciences throughout the world.
The journey begins by explaining basic statistical and research concepts before a guided tour of the R software environment. Next you discover the importance of exploring and graphing data, before moving onto statistical tests that are the foundations of the rest of the book (for example correlation and regression). You will then stride confidently into intermediate level analyses such as ANOVA, before ending your journey with advanced techniques such as MANOVA and multilevel models. Although there is enough theory to help you gain the necessary conceptual understanding of what you're doing, the emphasis is on applying what you learn to playful and real-world examples that should make the experience more fun than you might expect.
Like its sister textbooks, Discovering Statistics Using R is written in an irreverent style and follows the same ground-breaking structure and pedagogical approach. The core material is augmented by a cast of characters to help the reader on their way, together with hundreds of examples, self-assessment tests to consolidate knowledge, and additional website material for those wanting to learn more.

4065,"Redoute, Roses (Taschen 25th Anniversary)",Petra-Andrea Hinz,Painting Textbooks,"Arts, Film & Photography",3.561816664,5,1,Hardcover,2007,Sep,"The refined and revered tradition of botanical illustration, produced under aristocratic patronage, stretches back to the Renaissance. It emerged out of the desire to catalogue nature in all its wild splendour, and it was a process that demanded the most precise and skilful of artists. French flower painter Pierre-Joseph Redoute is often viewed as one of the last and the best of these painters and engravers. Commissioned by among others, Napoleon's Josephine, Redoute studied with the finest flower painters in France and Amsterdam, and developed a breathtaking skill at translating his observations of nature onto paper. His illustrations of the botanical alphabets of D. M. Guillamain were a landmark in flower painting for their accuracy and beauty. He was also an innovator in the techniques of printing, introducing ""stipple-engraving"" to France, always striving for greater exactitude in his art. This is a glorious and completely faithful reproduction of his most celebrated work ""Les Roses"", which was published in three volumes between 1817 and 1824. In ""Les Roses"", he turns his attention to that most romantic and evocative of subjects, and this handsome volume preserves every detail of Redoute's masterful representation of nature's gifts."

The Voynich Manuscript is produced from new photographs of the entire original and accompanied by expert essays that invite anyone to understand and explore the enigma. Many call the fifteenth-century codex, commonly known as the ""Voynich Manuscript,"" the world's most mysterious book. Written in an unknown script by an unknown author, the manuscript has no clearer purpose now than when it was rediscovered in 1912 by rare books dealer Wilfrid Voynich. The manuscript appears and disappears throughout history, from the library of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to a secret sale of books in 1903 by the Society of Jesus in Rome. The book's language has eluded decipherment, and its elaborate illustrations remain as baffling as they are beautiful. For the first time, this facsimile, complete with elaborate folding sections, allows readers to explore this enigma in all its stunning detail, from its one-of-a-kind ""Voynichese"" text to its illustrations of otherworldly plants, unfamiliar constellations, and naked women swimming though fantastical tubes and green baths. The essays that accompany the manuscript explain what we have learned about this work-from alchemical, cryptographic, forensic, and historical perspectives-but they provide few definitive answers. Instead, as New York Times best-selling author Deborah Harkness says in her introduction, the book ""invites the reader to join us at the heart of the mystery."""

From the squalid alleys of the East End to the Houses of Parliament, from church naves to dens of the occult, all of London feels the uniquely irresistable blend of fascination, revulsion, and panic that the Ripper offers. The city teeters on the brink of the twentieth century, and only the slightest prodding is necessary to plunge it into a modern age of terror.

Moore and Campbell have created a gripping, hallucinatory piece of crime fiction about Jack the Ripper. Detailing the events that led up to the Whitechapel murders and the cover-up that followed, From Hell is a modern masterpiece of crime noir and historical fiction."

5577,"The Horse, the Wheel, and Language ‚Äì How Bronze‚ÄìAge Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World",David W. Anthony,Anthropology (Books),"Arts, Film & Photography",3.278982117,3.8,3,Paperback,2010,Sep,"Roughly half the world's population speaks languages derived from a shared linguistic source known as Proto-Indo-European. But who were the early speakers of this ancient mother tongue, and how did they manage to spread it around the globe? Until now their identity has remained a tantalizing mystery to linguists, archaeologists, and even Nazis seeking the roots of the Aryan race. The Horse, the Wheel, and Language lifts the veil that has long shrouded these original Indo-European speakers, and reveals how their domestication of horses and use of the wheel spread language and transformed civilization. Linking prehistoric archaeological remains with the development of language, David Anthony identifies the prehistoric peoples of central Eurasia's steppe grasslands as the original speakers of Proto-Indo-European, and shows how their innovative use of the ox wagon, horseback riding, and the warrior's chariot turned the Eurasian steppes into a thriving transcontinental corridor of communication, commerce, and cultural exchange. He explains how they spread their traditions and gave rise to important advances in copper mining, warfare, and patron-client political institutions, thereby ushering in an era of vibrant social change. Anthony also describes his fascinating discovery of how the wear from bits on ancient horse teeth reveals the origins of horseback riding. The Horse, the Wheel, and Language solves a puzzle that has vexed scholars for two centuries--the source of the Indo-European languages and English--and recovers a magnificent and influential civilization from the past."

Shooting under available light gives exposure, but lacks depth, contrast, contour, atmosphere and often separation. The story could be the greatest in the world, but if the lighting is poor viewers will assume it's amateurish and not take it seriously. Feature films and TV shows, commercials and industrial videos, reality TV and documentaries, even event and wedding videos tell stories. Good lighting can make them look real, while real lighting often makes them look fake. Lighting for Cinematography, the first volume in the new CineTech Guides to the Film Crafts series, is the indispensable guide for film and video lighting. Written by veteran gaffer and cinematographer David Landau, the book helps the reader create lighting that supports the emotional moment of the scene, contributes to the atmosphere of the story and augments an artistic style. Structured to mimic a 14 week semester, the chapters cover such things as lighting for movement, working with windows, night lighting, lighting the three plains of action and non-fiction lighting. Every chapter includes stills, lighting diagrams and key advice from professionals in the field, as well as lighting exercises to help the reader put into practice what was covered. www.lightingforcinematography.com"

He wanders from house to house buying old newspapers, broken utensils, plastic bottles-anything for which he can get a little cash. This custom persists and recreates itself alongside the new economies and ecologies of consumer capitalism. Waste of a Nation offers an anthropological and historical account of India's complex relationship with garbage. Countries around the world struggle to achieve sustainable futures. Assa Doron and Robin Jeffrey argue that in India the removal of waste and efforts to reuse it also lay waste to the lives of human beings. At the bottom of the pyramid, people who work with waste are injured and stigmatized as they deal with sewage, toxic chemicals, and rotting garbage. Terrifying events, such as atmospheric pollution and childhood stunting, that touch even the wealthy and powerful may lead to substantial changes in practices and attitudes toward sanitation. And innovative technology along with more effective local government may bring about limited improvements. But if a clean new India is to emerge as a model for other parts of the world, a ""binding morality"" that reaches beyond the current environmental crisis will be required. Empathy for marginalized underclasses-Dalits, poor Muslims, landless migrants-who live, almost invisibly, amid waste produced predominantly for the comfort of the better-off will be the critical element in India's relationship with waste. Solutions will arise at the intersection of the traditional and the cutting edge, policy and practice, science and spirituality."

253,Islamic Patterns: An Analytical and Cosmological Approach,Keith Critchlow,Design,Humour,3.227115083,3,1,Paperback,1976,Jun,"For centuries the nature and meaning of Islamic art has been misunderstood in the West, being regarded as no more than decoration. But in fact the abstract art of Islam represents the sophisticated development of a supra-naturalistic tradition, since the portrayal of human and animal forms has always been discouraged by the Prophet Muhammad, so as to avoid idolatry. Hence, among the world's great artistic traditions, Islamic art has maintained its singular integrity and inner content with the least diversion from its aim: the affirmation of unity as expressed in diversity. The Pythagorean/Platonic doctrines are easily recognizable in the body of Islamic geometric art, as the wisdom of this practice was exalted by Socrates, in Plato's Republic dialogue (527), when he specifically gave the reason for practising geometry. Its practice rekindled the inner organ (or eye of wisdom) by which alone we can see the truth. The geometrical patterns of Islamic art reveal to the eye of the sensitive onlooker the intrinsic cosmological laws affecting all Creation. The primary function of these patterns is to lead the mind from the literal and mundane world towards the underlying permanent reality. The numerous sequential drawings show how the art of Islam is inseparable from the science of mathematics. Thus, we can see clearly how an Earth-centred - 'common-sense' - view of the cosmos gives renewed signficance to the number patterns produced by the orbits of the planets, correlating the cosmos as experienced by man with the patterns created in Islamic art, and thereby throwing new light on the perennial symbolic significance of number. The mathematical tessellations inherent in space-filling patterns are revealed as an essential practical and philosophical basis for the creation of each completed work of art - whether a tile, a carpet, a wall or an entire building - and thus affirm the underlying essential unity of all things."

What‚Äôs the surest way to startup failure? Follow old, outdated rules.
In Content Inc., one of today‚Äôs most sought-after content-marketing strategists reveals a new model for entrepreneurial success. Simply put, it‚Äôs about developing valuable content, building an audience around that content, and then creating a product for that audience.
Notice a shift?
Author Joe Pulizzi flips the traditional entrepreneurial approach of first creating a product and then trying to find customers. It‚Äôs a brilliant reverse-engineering of a model that rarely succeeds.
The radical six-step business-building process revealed in this book is smart, simple, practical, and cost-effective. And best of all, it works. It‚Äôs a strategy Pulizzi used to build his own successful company, Content Marketing Institute, which has landed on Inc. magazine‚Äôs list of fastest growing private companies for three years straight.  It‚Äôs also a strategy countless other entrepreneurs use to build their own multi-million dollar companies.  Build an audience and you‚Äôll be able to sell pretty much anything you want.
Today‚Äôs markets are more dynamic and customers are more fickle than ever before. Why would you put all your eggs in one basket before securing a loyal customer base? Content Inc. shows you how to get customers first and develop products later. It‚Äôs the best way to build a solid, long-lasting business positioned for today‚Äôs content-driven world.  This is the simple but profoundly successful entrepreneurial approach of one of today‚Äôs most creative business minds.
A pioneer of content marketing, Pulizzi has cracked to code when it comes to the power of content in a world where marketers still hold fast to traditional models that no longer work. In Content Inc., he breaks down the business-startup process into six steps, making it simple for you to visualize, launch, and monetize your own business. These steps are:
‚Ä¢ The ‚ÄúSweet Spot‚Äù: Identify the intersection of your unique competency and your personal passion
‚Ä¢ Content Tilting: Determine how you can ‚Äútilt‚Äù your sweet spot to find a place where little or no competition exists
‚Ä¢ Building the Base: Establish your number-one channel for disseminating content (blog, podcast, YouTube, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Harvesting Audience: Use social-media and SEO to convert one-time visitors into long-term subscribers
‚Ä¢ Diversification: Grow your business by expanding into multiple delivery channels
‚Ä¢ Monetization: Now that your expertise is established, you can begin charging money for your products or services
This model has worked wonders for Pulizzi and countless other examples detailed in the book. Connect these six pieces like a puzzle, and before you know it, you‚Äôll be running your own profitable, scalable business.
Pulizzi walks you step by step through the process, based on his own success (and failures) and real-world multi-million dollar examples from multiple industries and countries.
Whether you‚Äôre seeking to start a brand-new business or drive innovation in an existing one, Content Inc. provides everything you need to reverse-engineer the traditional entrepreneurial model for better, more sustainable success.
Joe Pulizzi is an entrepreneur, professional speaker, and podcaster.

2221,I Can't Make This Up: Life Lessons,Kevin Hart,Biographies & Autobiographies (Books),Humour,3.190051418,4.9,19,Hardcover,2017,Jun,"INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER

Superstar comedian and Hollywood box office star Kevin Hart turns his immense talent to the written word by writing some words. Some of those words include: the, a, for, above, and even even. Put them together and you have the funniest, most heartfelt, and most inspirational memoir on survival, success, and the importance of believing in yourself since Old Yeller.

The question you‚Äôre probably asking yourself right now is: What does Kevin Hart have that a book also has?

According to the three people who have seen Kevin Hart and a book in the same room, the answer is clear:

A book is compact. Kevin Hart is compact.

A book has a spine that holds it together. Kevin Hart has a spine that holds him together.

A book has a beginning. Kevin Hart‚Äôs life uniquely qualifies him to write this book by also having a beginning.

It begins in North Philadelphia. He was born an accident, unwanted by his parents. His father was a drug addict who was in and out of jail. His brother was a crack dealer and petty thief. And his mother was overwhelmingly strict, beating him with belts, frying pans, and his own toys.

The odds, in short, were stacked against our young hero, just like the odds that are stacked against the release of a new book in this era of social media (where Hart has a following of over 100 million, by the way).

But Kevin Hart, like Ernest Hemingway, JK Rowling, and Chocolate Droppa before him, was able to defy the odds and turn it around. In his literary debut, he takes the reader on a journey through what his life was, what it is today, and how he‚Äôs overcome each challenge to become the man he is today.

And that man happens to be the biggest comedian in the world, with tours that sell out football stadiums and films that have collectively grossed over $3.5 billion.

He achieved this not just through hard work, determination, and talent: It was through his unique way of looking at the world. Because just like a book has chapters, Hart sees life as a collection of chapters that each person gets to write for himself or herself.

‚ÄúNot only do you get to choose how you interpret each chapter, but your interpretation writes the next chapter,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSo why not choose the interpretation that serves your life the best?‚Äù"

In secluded and remote high-altitude-valleys of breath-taking grandeur he documented some of the last refuges of Tibetan and early Indian culture and photographed people and the unique testimonies of their art, religion and architecture. With the aid of rare archival and contemporary textual and visual materials, many seen here for the first time ever, the author draws a comprehensive picture of the fascinating history of the exploration of the present Indian border region towards Tibet. Knowledgably he describes the customs of its various inhabitants many of whom still follow their age-old traditions which at present are being stimulated and revived by the many exiled Tibetans that have found a new home in the region, thus designating it as 'Tibetan India.'

Strangers meet at it for the first time. Paramours carve their initials into it. Old friends sit and chat upon it for hours. Others ignore the bench, or (attempt to) sleep on it at night, or simply anchor themselves on it and absorb the ebb and flow of the area and its people.

Alone on the Wall reveals him to be an utterly unique and extremely appealing young man.' Jon Krakauer A twelve-year-old kid in the audience raised his hand and asked, 'Aren't you afraid you're gonna die?' Without missing a beat, Alex shot back, 'We've all gotta die sometimes. You might as well go big.' Alex Honnold is 28 years old, and perhaps the world's best 'free solo' climber, scaling impossible rock faces without ropes, pitons or and support of any kind. There is a purity to Alex's climbs that is easy to comprehend, but impossible to fathom; in the last forty years, only a handful of climbers have pushed 'free soloing' to the razor edge of risk. Half of them are dead. From Yosemite's famous Half Dome to the frighteningly difficult El Sendero Luminoso in Mexico, Alone on the Wall is structured around Alex's seven most extraordinary climbing achievements so far. These are tales to make your palms sweat and your feet curl with vertigo. Together, they get to the heart of how - and why - Alex does what he does. Exciting, uplifting and truly awe-inspiring, Alone on the Wall is a book about the essential truths of risk and reward, and the ability to maintain a singular focus, even in the face of extreme danger."

2525,Islamic Patterns: An Analytical and Cosmological Approach,Keith Critchlow,Design,"Arts, Film & Photography",3.1532049,3,1,Paperback,1976,Jun,"For centuries the nature and meaning of Islamic art has been misunderstood in the West, being regarded as no more than decoration. But in fact the abstract art of Islam represents the sophisticated development of a supra-naturalistic tradition, since the portrayal of human and animal forms has always been discouraged by the Prophet Muhammad, so as to avoid idolatry. Hence, among the world's great artistic traditions, Islamic art has maintained its singular integrity and inner content with the least diversion from its aim: the affirmation of unity as expressed in diversity. The Pythagorean/Platonic doctrines are easily recognizable in the body of Islamic geometric art, as the wisdom of this practice was exalted by Socrates, in Plato's Republic dialogue (527), when he specifically gave the reason for practising geometry. Its practice rekindled the inner organ (or eye of wisdom) by which alone we can see the truth. The geometrical patterns of Islamic art reveal to the eye of the sensitive onlooker the intrinsic cosmological laws affecting all Creation. The primary function of these patterns is to lead the mind from the literal and mundane world towards the underlying permanent reality. The numerous sequential drawings show how the art of Islam is inseparable from the science of mathematics. Thus, we can see clearly how an Earth-centred - 'common-sense' - view of the cosmos gives renewed signficance to the number patterns produced by the orbits of the planets, correlating the cosmos as experienced by man with the patterns created in Islamic art, and thereby throwing new light on the perennial symbolic significance of number. The mathematical tessellations inherent in space-filling patterns are revealed as an essential practical and philosophical basis for the creation of each completed work of art - whether a tile, a carpet, a wall or an entire building - and thus affirm the underlying essential unity of all things."

FROM THE AUTHOR:
This is a book I wrote. Because I wrote it, I had to figure out what to put on the back cover to explain what it is. I tried to write a long, third-person summary that would imply how great the book is and also sound vaguely authoritative‚Äîlike maybe someone who isn‚Äôt me wrote it‚Äîbut I soon discovered that I‚Äôm not sneaky enough to pull it off convincingly. So I decided to just make a list of things that are in the book:

Pictures
Words
Stories about things that happened to me
Stories about things that happened to other people because of me
Eight billion dollars*
Stories about dogs
The secret to eternal happiness*

*These are lies. Perhaps I have underestimated my sneakiness!"

5237,The Truth About Muhammad: Founder of the World's Most Intolerant Religion,Robert Spencer,Political Ideologies (Books),Politics,3.103119254,3.6,35,Paperback,2007,Jul,"Muhammad: a frank look at his influential (and violent) life and teachings

In The Truth about Muhammad, New York Times bestselling author and Islam expert Robert Spencer offers an honest and telling portrait of the founder of Islam-perhaps the first such portrait in half a century-unbounded by fear and political correctness, unflinching, and willing to face the hard facts about Muhammad's life that continue to affect our world today.

From Muhammad's first ""revelation"" from Allah (which filled him with terror that he was demonpossessed) to his deathbed (from which he called down curses upon Jews and Christians), it's all here-told with extensive documentation from the sources that Muslims themselves consider most reliable about Muhammad.

Spencer details Muhammad's development from a preacher of hellfire and damnation into a political and military leader who expanded his rule by force of arms, promising his warriors luridly physical delights in Paradise if they were killed in his cause. He explains how the Qur'an's teaching on warfare against unbelievers developed-with constant war to establish the hegemony of Islamic law as the last stage.

Spencer also gives the truth about Muhammad's convenient ""revelations"" justifying his own licentiousness; his joy in the brutal murders of his enemies; and above all, his clear marching orders to his followers to convert non-Muslims to Islam-or force them to live as inferiors under Islamic rule.

In The Truth about Muhammad, you'll learn

- The truth about Muhammad's multiple marriages (including one to a nine-year-old) - How Muhammad set legal standards that make it virtually impossible to prove rape in Islamic countries - How Muhammad's example justifies jihad and terrorism - The real ""Satanic verses"" incident (not the Salman Rushdie version) that remains a scandal to Muslims - How Muhammad's faulty knowledge of Judaism and Christianity has influenced Islamic theology--and colored Muslim relations with Jews and Christians to this day.

Recognizing the true nature of Islam, Spencer argues, is essential for judging the prospects for largescale Islamic reform, the effective prosecution of the War on Terror, the democracy project in Afghanistan and Iraq, and immigration and border control to protect the United States from terrorism.

All of which makes it crucial for every citizen (and policymaker) who loves freedom to read and ponder The Truth about Muhammad"

But what if we could regain some of our lost evolutionary strength by simulating the environmental conditions of our ancestors?
Investigative journalist and anthropologist Scott Carney takes up the challenge to find out: Can we hack our bodies and use the environment to stimulate our inner biology? Helping him in his search for the answers is Dutch fitness guru Wim Hof, whose ability to control his body temperature in extreme cold has sparked a whirlwind of scientific study. Carney also enlists input from an Army scientist, a world-famous surfer, the founders of an obstacle course race movement, and ordinary people who have documented how they have cured autoimmune diseases, lost weight, and reversed diabetes. In the process, he chronicles his own transformational journey as he pushes his body and mind to the edge of endurance, a quest that culminates in a record-bending, 28-hour climb to the snowy peak of Mt. Kilimanjaro wearing nothing but a pair of running shorts and sneakers.
An ambitious blend of investigative reporting and participatory journalism, What Doesn‚Äôt Kill Us explores the true connection between the mind and the body and reveals the science that allows us to push past our perceived limitations."

This period of dynamism ushered in an increased sense of confidence, aspiration and pride in being Indian. This book is about the response of the design community to India's changing environment. It focuses on fashion, graphic and interior design as metaphors of the complex networks that constitute globalisation within key metropolitan centres of India. Examined within the context of their production and consumption, and through their economic, social, political and cultural underpinnings, a picture emerges which conveys how designers grapple with issues of identity and globalisation, nationhood and modernity, ethics and commerce."
4620,Mission R&AW,RK Yadav (Former R&AW Officer),Politics (Books),Politics,3.07809415,3.7,28,Hardcover,2014,Apr,"This book would probably be the first eye opening account which has unlocked the main achievements and failures of Indian intelligence including IB and R&AW. There had been various assumptions, apprehensions and pretensions about the myths and realities of our intelligence among media, security analysts and in defence forces which have been threadbare for the public of this country in general and for the new generation in particular. It begins as to how the 'Thuggi and Dacoity' Department created by the British in 1904 took the shape of Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) on September 21, 1968 which proved one of the most formidable intelligence agency of the world. Its founder R.N. Kao proved one of the most outstanding and legendary intelligence icon which has no parallel in the intelligence fraternity of the world. He outclassed Richard Helms of CIA and many other contemporaries of MI6 of Britain and Mossad of Israel while merging a territory of 3000 sq. miles of Sikkim within the Indian territory. There is no other example in the world intelligence as to how R&AW and its icon R.N. Kao carried out this task in the face of an imminent threat by China on its border. This book also reveals Kao's heroics in the liberation of Bangladesh which was also a monumental contribution.

This book also unfolds as to how Article 370 was enacted for the ego problem of Sheikh Abdullah by Jawaharlal Nehru and how Sheikh betrayed him later and was arrested for treason by IB. There had been numerous stories criticizing IB for its failure to provide adequate intelligence during the 1962 War with China and 1965 War with Pakistan. This book has given credible instances and information which indicate that there was no civil intelligence failure but the army bosses failed to use the inputs in the forward areas. Factual details as to how CIA hoodwinked the R&AW Joint Secretary Rabinder Singh and took him to USA through Nepal are also given in a separate chapter.

In addition to these achievements, the book has portrayed decline of the quality of intelligence which has now denigrated to a level which needs urgent reforms otherwise future of R&AW would be gloomy. Some insights of R&AW could be lethal to some individuals but in fact these are the real facts for which the author has no regret to reveal in national interest and for the attention of comming generation of intelligence officers. These revelations make a strong case for bringing the intelligence agencies of India under Parliament scrutiny like CIA of USA and other such agencies of the world democracies otherwise the happenings like attack on Parliament or 26/11 terrorist act of Mumbai are unlikely to be thwarted in future."

Drawing from his friendships with composers and performers as well as his knowledge of new physics and Tantra, cybernetics, Sufism, and the works of Hermann Hesse, he reveals the importance of sound in shaping cultural and spiritual life worldwide.

A tribute to the work of many of the greatest figures of our age--including Hans Kayser, Jean Gebser, Sufi Hazrat lnayat Khan, musicians John Coltrane and Ravi Shankar--Berendt‚Äôs book suggests that hearing, rather than seeing, is the key to a more spiritual experience of consciousness.

The impossible has happened: The Joker has become a ... hero?

Batman: White Knight follows the man now known as Jack Napier as he embarks on a quest to heal the city he once terrorized. After reconciling with his long-suffering partner, Harley Quinn, he sets in motion a carefully plotted campaign to discredit the one person whom he views as Gotham City's true enemy: Batman.

His crusade exposes a decades-long history of corruption within the Gotham City Police Department and transforms Napier into a city councilman and civic hero. But when the sins of his past return to threaten everything that he has accomplished, the distinctions between savior and destroyer begin to break down for both The Joker and Batman alike--and with them any hope for Gotham's future.

An undisputed modernist classic, its ceaseless verbal inventiveness and astonishing wide-ranging allusions confirms its standing as an imperishable monument to the human condition. Declan Kiberd says in his introduction that Ulysses is 'an endlessly open book of utopian epiphanies. It holds a mirror up to the colonial capital that was Dublin on 16 June 1904, but it also offers redemptive glimpses of a future world which might be made over in terms of those utopian moments.' This Annotated Student Edition has full explanatory notes and line numbers for critical reference."

Richly illustrated and easy to navigate, it pairs clear explanations of every design concept with visual examples of the ideas applied in practice. From the 80/20 Rule to the Weakest Link, every major design concept is defined and illustrated.

Whether a marketing campaign or a museum exhibit, a video game or a complex control system, the design we see is the culmination of many concepts and practices brought together from a variety of disciplines. Because no one can be an expert on everything, designers have always had to scramble to find the information and know-how required to make a design work‚Äîuntil now.

Just a few of the principles that will broaden your design knowledge, promote brainstorming, and help you check the quality of your work:
Baby-Face Bias
Expectation Effect
Golden Ration
Ockham's Razor
Proximity
Scaling Fallacy
The book is organized alphabetically so that principles can be easily and quickly referenced by name. For those interested in addressing a specific problem of design, the principles havealso been indexed by questions commonly confronting designers (How can I help people learn from my design? How can I enhance the usability of a design? How can I make better design decisions? ...).

Each principle is presented in a two-page format. The left-hand page contains a succinct definition, a full description of the principle, examples of its use, and guidelines for use. Side notes appear to the right of the text, and provide elaborations and references. The right-hand page contains visual examples and related graphics to support a deeper understanding of the principle.

This landmark reference is the standard for designers, engineers, architects, and students who seek to broaden and improve their design expertise."

Your cell phone provider tracks your location and knows who‚Äôs with you. Your online and in-store purchasing patterns are recorded, and reveal if you're unemployed, sick, or pregnant. Your e-mails and texts expose your intimate and casual friends. Google knows what you‚Äôre thinking because it saves your private searches. Facebook can determine your sexual orientation without you ever mentioning it.
The powers that surveil us do more than simply store this information. Corporations use surveillance to manipulate not only the news articles and advertisements we each see, but also the prices we‚Äôre offered. Governments use surveillance to discriminate, censor, chill free speech, and put people in danger worldwide. And both sides share this information with each other or, even worse, lose it to cybercriminals in huge data breaches.
Much of this is voluntary: we cooperate with corporate surveillance because it promises us convenience, and we submit to government surveillance because it promises us protection. The result is a mass surveillance society of our own making. But have we given up more than we‚Äôve gained? In Data and Goliath, security expert Bruce Schneier offers another path, one that values both security and privacy. He shows us exactly what we can do to reform our government surveillance programs and shake up surveillance-based business models, while also providing tips for you to protect your privacy every day. You'll never look at your phone, your computer, your credit cards, or even your car in the same way again."

She‚Äôs the creator and producer of some of the most groundbreaking and audacious shows on television today. Her iconic characters live boldly and speak their minds. So who would suspect that Shonda Rhimes is an introvert? That she hired a publicist so she could avoid public appearances? That she suffered panic attacks before media interviews?

With three children at home and three hit television shows, it was easy for Shonda to say she was simply too busy. But in truth, she was also afraid. And then, over Thanksgiving dinner, her sister muttered something that was both a wake up and a call to arms: You never say yes to anything. Shonda knew she had to embrace the challenge: for one year, she would say YES to everything that scared her.

This poignant, intimate, and hilarious memoir explores Shonda‚Äôs life before her Year of Yes‚Äîfrom her nerdy, book-loving childhood to her devotion to creating television characters who reflected the world she saw around her. The book chronicles her life after her Year of Yes had begun‚Äîwhen Shonda forced herself out of the house and onto the stage; when she learned to explore, empower, applaud, and love her truest self.

Mann and the Pulitzer Prize-winning political cartoonist Tom Toles have been on the front lines of the fight against climate denialism for most of their careers. They have witnessed the manipulation of the media by business and political interests and the unconscionable play to partisanship on issues that affect the well-being of billions. The lessons they have learned have been invaluable, inspiring this brilliant, colorful escape hatch from the madhouse of the climate wars. The Madhouse Effect portrays the intellectual pretzels into which denialists must twist logic to explain away the clear evidence that human activity has changed Earth's climate. Toles's cartoons collapse counter-scientific strategies into their biased components, helping readers see how to best strike at these fallacies. Mann's expert skills at science communication aim to restore sanity to a debate that continues to rage against widely acknowledged scientific consensus. The synergy of these two climate science crusaders enlivens the gloom and doom of so many climate-themed books-and may even convert die-hard doubters to the side of sound science."

He asks us to imagine hundreds of millions of people producing their own green energy in their homes, offices, and factories, and sharing it with each other in an ""energy internet,"" just like we now create and share information online.
Rifkin describes how the five-pillars of the Third Industrial Revolution will create thousands of businesses, millions of jobs, and usher in a fundamental reordering of human relationships, from hierarchical to lateral power, that will impact the way we conduct commerce, govern society, educate our children, and engage in civic life.
Rifkin's vision is already gaining traction in the international community. The European Union Parliament has issued a formal declaration calling for its implementation, and other nations in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, are quickly preparing their own initiatives for transitioning into the new economic paradigm.
The Third Industrial Revolution is an insider's account of the next great economic era, including a look into the personalities and players ‚Äï heads of state, global CEOs, social entrepreneurs, and NGOs ‚Äï who are pioneering its implementation around the world."

In this collection of short Sufi verses, originally composed for musical performance, the poet creates a vast imaginative world of interlocking references to traditional Islamic themes of mystical and divine love and the scenery, society, and legends of the Sindh region. Latif (1689-1752), a contemporary of the Panjabi poet Bullhe Shah, belonged to the class of Sufi saints whose shrines remain prominent features of the Sindhi landscape. The Risalo reflects Latif's profound engagement with the fundamental literature of Islam as well as his openness to varied local traditions, including notable poems praising the spiritual devotion of local Hindu yogis. This edition presents, alongside the original text in the Sindhi Naskh script, the first translation of the Risalo into modern English prose, offering a new readership access to the writings of one of the masters of Sufi poetry."

2813,Private Life Of Chairman Mao: The Memoirs of Mao's Personal Physician,Zhisui Li,Asian History,Politics,2.980003372,4.6,3,Paperback,1996,Apr,"For the first time, here is the extraordinary true story of one of the most powerful men, and ruthless dictators, who ever lived.

Mao Zedong had control over more people for a longer period than any other leader in history. In this intimate biography we learn not only about the imperial grandeur of his life in a country racked by poverty and the vicious infighting at his court, but also about his extraordinary personal habits that equal those of deceased Korean supreme leader, Kim Jong Il, another infamous and idiosyncratic dictator, equally deified and worshipped by his followers: Mao's teeth turned black because he would only brush them with tea; he hardly ever bathed but then received Krushchev in his swimming pool where he obliged the Soviet President to join him. Li's revealing account also chronicles Mao's voracious sexual appetite that led to the seduction of thousands of peasant women because he believed in the mythical healing power of sex.

Zhisui Li spent more time with Mao than perhaps any other person. He witnessed first-hand the catastrophic events that Mao's dotage and paranoia sparked in a country that revered him as a demi-god. The Private Life of Chairman Mao is a landmark biography, as fascinating as it is important to the understanding of modern China, and a must buy for fans of Wild Swans."

Rather than trying to genuinely relate to other people we tell them what we think they need to know or should do based on assumptions we‚Äôve made about them.

Humble Inquiry builds the kinds of positive, trusting, balanced relationships that encourage honest and open interactions in both our professional and personal lives. Schein defines Humble Inquiry as ‚Äúthe fine art of drawing someone out, of asking questions to which you do not know the answer, of building a relationship based on curiosity and interest in the other person.‚Äù In this seminal work he explores the concept of humility, looks at how Humble Inquiry differs from other kinds of inquiry, offers examples of Humble Inquiry in action in many different settings, and shows how to overcome the cultural, organizational and psychological barriers that keep us from practicing it This is a major new contribution to how we see human dynamics and relationships, presented in a compact, personal, eminently practical way."

What happens when America's First Son falls in love with the Prince of Wales?
When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the American equivalent of a young royal. Handsome, charismatic, genius‚Äïhis image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse.
Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through? Casey McQuiston's Red, White & Royal Blue proves: true love isn't always diplomatic.

It shows how the policies deployed to ‚Äòcreate order in disorder‚Äô functioned inversely and turned Kashmir into a smoldering volcano which erupted in 1989‚Äì90.
The author argues that as the issue of dispute and policy framework has been constant, the clash between the status quoist state and the society was inevitable. The crisis deepened along with technological, economic, cultural, and social changes. Based on a variety of contemporary sources, this book deals with many aspects of Kashmir‚Äôs governance through different political phases.

You'd be wrong. When he buys a beach house on the Carolina coast, Sedaris envisions long, relaxing vacations spent playing board games and lounging in the sun with those he loves most. And life at the Sea Section, as he names the vacation home, is exactly as idyllic as he imagined, except for one tiny, vexing realization: it's impossible to take a vacation from yourself. With Calypso, Sedaris sets his formidable powers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Make no mistake: these stories are very, very funny - it's a book that can make you laugh 'til you snort, the way only family can. Sedaris's writing has never been sharper and his ability to shock readers into laughter unparalleled. But much of the comedy here is born out of that vertiginous moment when your own body betrays you and you realize that the story of your life is made up of more past than future. This is beach reading for people who detest beaches, required reading for those who loathe small talk and love a good tumour joke. Calypso is simultaneously Sedaris's darkest and warmest book yet - and it just might be his very best."

Over the past three decades, the bounds of the possible in action and adventure sports - from sky-diving to motocross to surfing and beyond - have been pushed farther and faster. A generation's worth of iconoclastic misfits have rewritten the rules of the feasible; not just raising the bar, but obliterating it altogether. Along the way, they have become a force pushing evolution relentlessly onward. In a thrilling narrative that draws on biology, psychology, and philosophy, Steven Kotler asks why, at the tail end of the 20th century and the early portion of the 21st, are we seeing such a multi-sport assault on reality? Did we somehow slip through a wormhole to another universe where gravity is optional and common sense obsolete? And where - if anywhere - do our actual limits lie?"

Now, in this twenty-fifth anniversary edition, acclaimed author and journalist Andrew Ferguson contributes a new essay that describes why Bloom‚Äôs argument caused such a furor at publication and why our culture so deeply resists its truths today."

‚ÄúTerrific . . . Far more insightful than your typical jock memoir, Ibra‚Äôs book tells his story of growing up as the son of immigrants in Sweden and pulls no punches when it comes to his opinions of some of the biggest names in the game.‚Äù‚ÄîSports Illustrated

‚ÄúThe most compelling autobiography ever to appear under a footballer‚Äôs name.‚Äù‚ÄîThe Guardian
 
‚ÄúThe story of Zlatan‚Äîfrom his days as an immigrant kid juggling a soccer ball so he won‚Äôt get bullied to his emergence as the genius player who scored the greatest goal ever‚Äîis as compelling and fancy-footed as his game.‚Äù‚ÄîAleksandar Hemon, National Book Award finalist and author of The Lazarus Project

‚ÄúI love this book. I love it because it‚Äôs so much bigger than soccer. I Am Zlatan is a story of hope and grit and what an immigrant kid who comes from nothing can accomplish with hard work and belief in himself. It‚Äôs also a beautiful window into our new, more open, more diverse world.‚Äù‚ÄîMarcus Samuelsson, bestselling author of Yes, Chef
 
‚ÄúProbably the bestselling European immigrant‚Äôs tale since Zadie Smith‚Äôs White Teeth . . . Once you get past the obligatory snigger prompted by the phrase ‚Äòfootballer‚Äôs autobiography,‚Äô you can see that Zlatan‚Äôs book strangely resembles an earlier immigrant‚Äôs tale: Portnoy‚Äôs Complaint.‚Äù‚ÄîFinancial Times

Thorp,Games & Quizzes (Books),Humour,2.910624405,3.9,11,Hardcover,2017,Jan,"The incredible true story of the card-counting mathematics professor who taught the world how to beat the dealer and, as the first of the great quantitative investors, ushered in a revolution on Wall Street.

A child of the Great Depression, legendary mathematician Edward O. Thorp invented card counting, proving the seemingly impossible: that you could beat the dealer at the blackjack table. As a result he launched a gambling renaissance. His remarkable success‚Äîand mathematically unassailable method‚Äîcaused such an uproar that casinos altered the rules of the game to thwart him and the legions he inspired. They barred him from their premises, even put his life in jeopardy. Nonetheless, gambling was forever changed.

Thereafter, Thorp shifted his sights to ‚Äúthe biggest casino in the world‚Äù: Wall Street. Devising and then deploying mathematical formulas to beat the market, Thorp ushered in the era of quantitative finance we live in today. Along the way, the so-called godfather of the quants played bridge with Warren Buffett, crossed swords with a young Rudy Giuliani, detected the Bernie Madoff scheme, and, to beat the game of roulette, invented, with Claude Shannon, the world‚Äôs first wearable computer.

Here, for the first time, Thorp tells the story of what he did, how he did it, his passions and motivations, and the curiosity that has always driven him to disregard conventional wisdom and devise game-changing solutions to seemingly insoluble problems. An intellectual thrill ride, replete with practical wisdom that can guide us all in uncertain financial waters, A Man for All Markets is an instant classic‚Äîa book that challenges its readers to think logically about a seemingly irrational world.

Praise for A Man for All Markets

‚ÄúIn A Man for All Markets, [Thorp] delightfully recounts his progress (if that is the word) from college teacher to gambler to hedge-fund manager. Along the way we learn important lessons about the functioning of markets and the logic of investment.‚Äù‚ÄîThe Wall Street Journal

‚Äú[Thorp] gives a biological summation (think Richard Feynman‚Äôs Surely You‚Äôre Joking, Mr. Feynman!) of his quest to prove the aphorism ‚Äòthe house always wins‚Äô is flawed. . . . Illuminating for the mathematically inclined, and cautionary for would-be gamblers and day traders‚Äù‚Äî

Taken from the Japanese words wabi, which translates to less is more, and sabi, which means attentive melancholy, wabi sabi refers to an awareness of the transient nature of earthly things and a corresponding pleasure in the things that bear the mark of this impermanence. As much a state of mind‚Äîan awareness of the things around us and an acceptance of our surroundings‚Äîas it is a design style, wabi sabi begs us to appreciate the pure beauty of life‚Äîa chipped vase, a quiet rainy day, the impermanence of all things. Presenting itself as an alternative to today's fast-paced, mass-produced, neon-lighted world, wabi sabi reminds us to slow down and take comfort in the natural beauty around us.

In addition to presenting the philosophy of wabi-sabi, this book includes how-to design advice‚Äîso that a transformation of body, mind, and home can emerge.

Chapters include:
History: The Development of Wabi Sabi
Culture: Wabi Sabi and the Japanese Character
Art: Defining Aesthetics
Design: Creating Expressions with Wabi Sabi Materials

From Paul Mason, the award-winning Channel 4 presenter, Postcapitalism is a guide to our era of seismic economic change, and how we can build a more equal society.
Over the past two centuries or so, capitalism has undergone continual change - economic cycles that lurch from boom to bust - and has always emerged transformed and strengthened. Surveying this turbulent history, Paul Mason wonders whether today we are on the brink of a change so big, so profound, that this time capitalism itself, the immensely complex system by which entire societies function, has reached its limits and is changing into something wholly new.
At the heart of this change is information technology: a revolution that, as Mason shows, has the potential to reshape utterly our familiar notions of work, production and value; and to destroy an economy based on markets and private ownership - in fact, he contends, it is already doing so.
In this groundbreaking, Sunday Times top ten book, Mason shows how, from the ashes of the recent financial crisis, we have the chance to create a more socially just and sustainable global economy."

In modern sports, some athletes have managed to transcend their competition in a way that no one will ever forget: Jordan. Jeter. Ali. Williams.

‚ÄúBrady is the healthiest great champion the NFL has ever had, both physically and mentally‚Äù (Sally Jenkins, The Washington Post).

In The TB12 Method, Tom Brady explains how he developed his groundbreaking approach to long-term fitness, presenting a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to his personal practice. Brady offers the principles behind pliability, which is at the heart of a new paradigm shift and movement toward a more natural, healthier way of exercising, training and living‚Äîand one that challenges some commonly held assumptions around health and wellness.

With instructions, drills, photos, in-depth case studies that Brady himself has used, as well as personal anecdotes and experiences from on and off the field, The TB12 Method is the only book an athlete will ever need, a playbook from Brady himself that will change the game."

2905,Architecture in Medieval India,Monica Juneja,Architecture (Books),"Arts, Film & Photography",2.873320602,5,1,Paperback,2008,None,"From the first half of the nineteenth century, the architectural history of medieval India has been the subject of diverse books, essays and miscellaneous writings. The present book pulls together the most significant of these writings, revealing the impressive array of historical ideas about India's past that has emerged through the study of its monuments. The writings reproduced here are located by the editor within the specific intellectual, political and socio-cultural contexts within which they emerged and were elaborated. By this means, Monica Juneja makes this anthology a major historiographical intervention which traces the colonial emergence and nationalist development of, as well as contemporary advances in, the discipline of architectural history both within India and in relation to art history in the West. Professor Juneja's introduction also examines the intellectual importance of architectural history for all historians, arguing that the study of India's medieval architecture needs to be made integral to every history of conquest, state-building, and the movements of populations and traditions across the subcontinent. She demonstrates that ideas about buildings and their histories have frequently been polemical and instrumental: they have been politically deployed to construct or fabricate a collective past. They have been used to provide symbolic meanings which have helped subjugate or unify heterogeneous communities and nations. In short, the architectural history of India's contentiously misnamed 'Muslim' period is revealed as the site of tensions between Hindus and Muslims, colonialists and nationalists, traditionalists and postmodernists. This book will open the eyes of general readers and students to the politics of interpreting monuments often taken for granted, even as it attempts to resensitise scholars to the vitality and overwhelming relevance of this sometimes neglected area of historiography."

His dream is the total eradication of poverty from the world. In 1983, against the advice of banking and government officials, Yunus established Grameen, a bank devoted to providing the poorest of Bangladesh with minuscule loans. Grameen Bank, based on the belief that credit is a basic human right, not the privilege of a fortunate few, now provides over 2.5 billion dollars of micro-loans to more than two million families in rural Bangladesh. Ninety-four percent of Yunus's clients are women, and repayment rates are near 100 percent. Around the world, micro-lending programs inspired by Grameen are blossoming, with more than three hundred programs established in the United States alone. Banker to the Poor is Muhammad Yunus's memoir of how he decided to change his life in order to help the world's poor. In it he traces the intellectual and spiritual journey that led him to fundamentally rethink the economic relationship between rich and poor, and the challenges he and his colleagues faced in founding Grameen. He also provides wise, hopeful guidance for anyone who would like to join him in ""putting homelessness and destitution in a museum so that one day our children will visit it and ask how we could have allowed such a terrible thing to go on for so long."" The definitive history of micro-credit direct from the man that conceived of it, Banker to the Poor is necessary and inspirational reading for anyone interested in economics, public policy, philanthropy, social history, and business. Muhammad Yunus was born in Bangladesh and earned his Ph.D. in economics in the United States at Vanderbilt University, where he was deeply influenced by the civil rights movement. He still lives in Bangladesh, and travels widely around the world on behalf of Grameen Bank and the concept of micro-credit."
1911,The Art of Asking: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Let People Help,Amanda Palmer,Biographies & Autobiographies (Books),Humour,2.86923172,3.2,3,Paperback,2015,Oct,"FOREWORD BY BRENE BROWN and POSTSCRIPT FROM BRAIN PICKINGS CREATOR MARIA POPOVA

Rock star, crowdfunding pioneer, and TED speaker Amanda Palmer knows all about asking. Performing as a living statue in a wedding dress, she wordlessly asked thousands of passersby for their dollars. When she became a singer, songwriter, and musician, she was not afraid to ask her audience to support her as she surfed the crowd (and slept on their couches while touring). And when she left her record label to strike out on her own, she asked her fans to support her in making an album, leading to the world's most successful music Kickstarter.

Even while Amanda is both celebrated and attacked for her fearlessness in asking for help, she finds that there are important things she cannot ask for-as a musician, as a friend, and as a wife. She learns that she isn't alone in this, that so many people are afraid to ask for help, and it paralyzes their lives and relationships. In this groundbreaking book, she explores these barriers in her own life and in the lives of those around her, and discovers the emotional, philosophical, and practical aspects of THE ART OF ASKING.

Part manifesto, part revelation, this is the story of an artist struggling with the new rules of exchange in the twenty-first century, both on and off the Internet. THE ART OF ASKING will inspire readers to rethink their own ideas about asking, giving, art, and love."

1377,Jose Mourinho: The Art of Winning,Andrew J. Kirby,Soccer (Books),Sports,2.866287339,5,1,Paperback,2016,Aug,"The manager everyone loves to hate¬Ö Mercurial Portuguese manager Jose Mourinho, who regards himself as football¬ís equivalent of George Clooney, featured in his own blockbuster this summer when he took charge of Manchester United ¬ñ the world¬ís biggest club. The news sent shockwaves through the Old Trafford faithful ¬ñ generations of whom have pledged their loyalty to a succession of managerial legends including Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson. At the very outset of what promises to be a tumultuous season for the Red Devils, Andrew J Kirby investigates in his latest book Jose Mourinho: The Art of Winning whether the latest controversial move by the club¬ís owners is a marriage made in heaven or hell. Machiavellian schemer, marketing man¬ís dream, inspirational leader and motivator, arrogant ¬ìmanager-lout¬î, Super Coach. Anti-hero. Serial trophy-winner. Jose Mourinho¬ís personality is a complex one. Jose Mourinho: The Art of Winning is an entertaining character study of the man who in many ways has come to define modern, elite-level football. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo apart, the biggest, most marketable stars in world football today are the managers. The 2016-17 edition of the FA Premier League is being billed as the most exciting yet, and that¬ís not because of the influx of star players after the European Championships in France. Though some eye-catching names have joined the league, none have the cache of a Messi or a Ronaldo. None have the standing of a Jose Mourinho or a Pep Guardiola either. And so it is on the manager¬ís shoulders that the responsibility for delivering the customary Premier League spectacle falls. Incorporating interviews with fans (of United, and of Mourinho¬ís former clubs), players (past and present), commentators and journalists, this book endeavours to determine what effect the Jose Mourinho show will have on Manchester United as a football club and the Premier League as a whole by tackling eight key questions including the following: Is Mourinho the best manager in the game?What is the management approach of Jose Mourinho? Can Manchester United tolerate the dark side of Jose Mourinho?What is the role of the modern day Premier League manager and how has this changed over the years?And:¬ìOnce a Blue, always a Red?¬îCan a manager who is so recognisably a Blue become a Red?Stuffed full of statistical detail and flavoured with a wistful view of a game, he sets the spectacular scene for a showdown of showdowns in this season¬ís Premier League campaign where the ultimate prize for United will be the crucial return to the Champions League. With interviews with football writers, players and fans, this book is a must that every Manchester United fan ¬ñ and indeed every football supporter ¬ñ needs to read. Andrew J Kirby¬ís sports-writing has featured in BBC Sport magazine and on the Radio Five Live website. He has held a Manchester United season ticket for over a quarter of a century and regularly follows the Reds across Europe and beyond. His other United books include, Fergie¬ís Finest: Sir Alex Ferguson¬ís First 11, The Pride of All Europe: Manchester United¬ís Greatest Seasons in the European Cup and Louis van Gaal: Dutch Courage.PRAISE FOR FERGIE¬íS FINESTA must read for any red.

For all his supernatural gifts as an artist and natural scientist. Leonardo was resolutely human (illegitimate, vegan, in need of patrons) rather than the near deity of legend. Isaacson is an assured guide to Leonardo's fallibility - so many projects started, so few completed - as well as his extraordinary curiosity and his even more remarkable painterly skills that were sharpened by intense observation.' Michael Prodger, Books of the Year - The Sunday Times 'Infinitely curious, easily distracted, vain and vegetarian, Leonardo is brought to vivid life in this accomplished biography.' - The SundayTimes. 'an illuminating guide to the output of one of the last millennium's greatest minds.' - The Observer 'Isaacson doesn't claim to make any fresh discoveries, but his book is intelligently organised, simply written and beautifully illustrated.' Book of the Day, The Guardian. 'Isaacson's scholarship is impressive-he cites not only primary sources but secondary materials by art critics, essayists, and da Vinci's other biographers. This is a monumental tribute to a titanic figure.' - Publisher's Weekly ""A powerful story of an exhilarating mind and life...a study in creativity: how to define it, how to achieve it.""-The New Yorker ""Vigorous, insightful.""-The Washington Post ""A masterpiece.""-San Francisco Chronicle ""Luminous.""-The Daily Beast 'To read this magnificent biography of Leonardo da Vinci is to take a tour through the life and works of one of the most extraordinary human beings of all time in the company of the most engaging, informed, and insightful guide imaginable. Walter Isaacson is at once a true scholar and a spellbinding writer. And what a wealth of lessons there are to be learned in these pages.' David McCullough The creator of Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World) officially sold at auction in New York in November 2017 for the record-breaking sum of GBP341 million. He was history's most creative genius. What secrets can he teach us? Based on thousands of pages from Leonardo's astonishing notebooks and new discoveries about his life and work, Walter Isaacson weaves a narrative that connects his art to his science. He shows how Leonardo's genius was based on skills we can improve in ourselves, such as passionate curiosity, careful observation, and an imagination so playful that it flirted with fantasy. He produced the two most famous paintings in history, The Last Supper and the Mona Lisa. But in his own mind, he was just as much a man of science and technology. With a passion that sometimes became obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, fossils, birds, the heart, flying machines, botany, geology, and weaponry. His ability to stand at the crossroads of the humanities and the sciences, made iconic by his drawing of Vitruvian Man, made him history's most creative genius. His creativity, like that of other great innovators, came from having wide-ranging passions. He peeled flesh off the faces of cadavers, drew the muscles that move the lips, and then painted history's most memorable smile. He explored the math of optics, showed how light rays strike the cornea, and produced illusions of changing perspectives in The Last Supper. Isaacson also describes how Leonardo's lifelong enthusiasm for staging theatrical productions informed his paintings and inventions. Leonardo's delight at combining diverse passions remains the ultimate recipe for creativity. So, too, does his ease at being a bit of a misfit: illegitimate, gay, vegetarian, left-handed, easily distracted, and at times heretical. His life should remind us of the importance of instilling, both in ourselves and our children, not just received knowledge but a willingness to question it-to be imaginative and, like talented misfits and rebels in any era, to think different."

2771,How To Eat: Vintage Classics Anniversary Edition,Nigella Lawson,Action & Adventure (Books),Action & Adventure,2.857332496,4.5,2,Paperback,2018,Oct,"'At its heart, a deeply practical yet joyously readable book‚Ä¶you are all set to head off to the kitchen and have a truly glorious time‚Äô Nigel Slater, Guardian


Celebrating the 20th anniversary of How to Eat: Revisit and discover the sensational debut cookbook from Nigella Lawson.

WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY JEANETTE WINTERSON

When Nigella Lawson‚Äôs first book, How to Eat, was published in 1998, two things were immediately clear: that this fresh and fiercely intelligent voice would revolutionise cookery writing, and that How to Eat was an instant classic of the genre.

Here was a versatile culinary bible, through which a generation discovered how to feel at home in the kitchen and found the confidence to experiment and adapt recipes to their own needs. This was the book to reach for when hastily organising a last-minute supper with friends, when planning a luxurious weekend lunch or contemplating a store-cupboard meal for one, or when trying to tempt a fussy toddler. This was a book about home cooking for busy lives.

The chief revelation was the writing. Rather than a set of intimidating instructions, Nigella‚Äôs recipes provide inspiration. She has a gift for finding the right word to spark the reader‚Äôs imagination, evoking the taste of the ingredients, the simple, sensual pleasures of the practical process, the deep reward of the finished dish. Passionate, trenchant, convivial and wise, Nigella‚Äôs prose demands to be savoured, and ensures that the joy and value of How to Eat will endure for decades to come.

With straightforward language and easy-to-follow steps, Yoga for Men will teach you how to execute the 50 key yoga postures you need for greater endurance, flexibility, balance, and strength - no leotards or chanting required!

Bill Bryson was struck one day by the thought that we devote a lot more time to studying the battles and wars of history than to considering what history really consists of: centuries of people quietly going about their daily business - eating, sleeping and merely endeavouring to get more comfortable. And that most of the key discoveries for humankind can be found in the very fabric of the houses in which we live.This inspired him to start a journey around his own house, an old rectory in Norfolk, wandering from room to room considering how the ordinary things in life came to be.

Along the way he did a prodigious amount of research on the history of anything and everything, from architecture to electricity, from food preservation to epidemics, from the spice trade to the Eiffel Tower, from crinolines to toilets; and on the brilliant, creative and often eccentric minds behind them. And he discovered that, although there may seem to be nothing as unremarkable as our domestic lives, there is a huge amount of history, interest and excitement - and even a little danger - lurking in the corners of every home."

A mix of popular psychology and trivia, You Are Now Less Dumb is grounded in the idea that we all believe ourselves to be objective observers of reality--except we‚Äôre not. But that‚Äôs okay, because our delusions keep us sane.
 
Expanding on this premise, McRaney provides eye-opening analyses of seventeen ways we fool ourselves every day, including:
Enclothed Cognition (the clothes you wear change your behavior and influence your mental abilities)
The Benjamin Franklin Effect (how you grow to like people for whom you do nice things and hate the people you harm).
Deindividuation (Despite our best intentions, we practically disappear when subsumed by a mob mentality)
The Misattribution of Arousal (Environmental factors have a greater effect on our emotional arousal than the person right in front of us)
Sunk Cost Fallacy (We will engage in something we don‚Äôt enjoy just to make the time or money already invested ‚Äúworth it‚Äù)

Wodehouse was, by common consent, the most brilliant writer of English comedy in the 20th century, equally celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic. He achieved the unusual distinction of combining the widest possible popularity with the highest literary standards, attracting both the devotion of readers and the respect of his peers from Hilaire Belloc to Graham Greene. Several of his characters have already entered popular mythology. This anthology includes two novels, fourteen short stories and extracts from Wodehouse's autobiography.
The Code of the Woosters was written in 1938 when Wodehouse was at the height of his powers. The vintage plot involves Bertie Wooster attempting to steal a cream jug from a country house at the behest of his aunt Dahlia - or, as Bertiehimself puts it, 'the sinister affair of Gussie Fink-Nottle, Madeleine Bassett, old Pop bassett, Stiffy Byng, the Rev H.P. ('Stinker') Pinker, the eighteenth-century cow-creamer and the small, brown, leather-covered notebook.' The outcome is a dazzlingly intricate plot and a wonderfully satisfying farce.
Uncle Fred in the Springtime, published in 1939, brings one of the author's favourite characters, Uncle Fred aka Lord Ickenham, to his most celebrated comic location, Blandings Castle, where the dastardly Duke of Dunstable is again attempting to steal Lord Emsworth's prize pig. Called in to thwart the duke, Uncle Fred poses as pompous 'looney-doctor' Sir Roderick Glossop, with complicated results. The short stories feature all Wodehouse's most famous creations - Jeeves and Wooster, Ukridge, Bingo Little, Mr Mulliner, the Earls of Emsworth and Ickenham. Finally, extracts from Over Seventy, a memoir as amusing and beautifully written as the novels, offer an insight into the attitudes and working habits of a very private man."

DARK NIGHT: A TRUE BATMAN STORY is the harrowing and eloquent autobiographical tale of Dini‚Äôs courageous struggle to overcome a truly desperate situation. It is a Batman story like no other and one that will truly resonate with fans, with art by the incredible and talented Eduardo Risso (100 BULLETS).
 
In the 1990s, writer Paul Dini had a flourishing career penning the hugely popular Batman: The Animated Series and Tiny Toon Adventures. It was a golden era of television screenwriting, and Dini and his fellow writers were at the forefront of the glittering Hollywood scene. In one night, everything would change.
 
Walking home one evening, Dini was jumped and viciously beaten. With several broken bones and a shattered face, Dini experienced an arduous recovery process, hampered by the imagined antics of the villains he was writing for television, including the Joker, Harley Quinn, and the Penguin. But despite how bleak his circumstances were, or perhaps because of it, Dini also always imagined the Batman at his side, constantly chivvying him along during his darkest moments.
 
While most know the Caped Crusader as the all-abiding icon of justice and authority, in this surprising story, we see Batman in a new light‚Äînot as the dark avenger, but the savior who helped a discouraged man recover mentally from a brutal attack that left him unable to face the world."

Having penetrated this closed world and persuaded its inhabitants to open up to him, Robert Neuwirth makes clear that this informal method of transaction dates back as far as humans have existed and traded, that it provides essential services and crucial employment that fill the gaps in formal systems, and that this unregulated market works smoothly and effectively, with its own codes and unwritten rules.
 
Combining a vivid travelogue with a firm grasp on global economic strategy‚Äîalong with a healthy dose of irreverence and skepticism toward conventional perceptions‚ÄîNeuwirth gives us an eye-opening account of a world that is always operating around us, hidden in plain sight."

He is ultra competitive but never forgets to have fun. An immensely likeable man. ' Damon Hill

The world‚Äôs foremost designer in Formula One, Adrian Newey OBE is arguably one of Britain‚Äôs greatest engineers and this is his fascinating, powerful memoir.

How to Build a Car explores the story of Adrian‚Äôs unrivalled 35-year career in Formula One through the prism of the cars he has designed, the drivers he has worked alongside and the races in which he‚Äôs been involved.

A true engineering genius, even in adolescence Adrian‚Äôs thoughts naturally emerged in shape and form ‚Äì he began sketching his own car designs at the age of 12 and took a welding course in his school summer holidays. From his early career in Indy Car racing and on to his unparalleled success in Formula One, we learn in comprehensive, engaging and highly entertaining detail how a car actually works. Adrian has designed for the likes of Mario Andretti, Nigel Mansell, Alain Prost, Damon Hill, David Coulthard, Mika Hakkinen, Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel, always with a shark-like purity of purpose: to make the
car go faster. And while his career has been marked by unbelievable triumphs, there have also been deep tragedies; most notably Ayrton Senna‚Äôs death during his time at Williams in 1994.

Beautifully illustrated with never-before-seen drawings, How to Build a Car encapsulates, through Adrian‚Äôs remarkable life story, precisely what makes Formula One so thrilling ‚Äì its potential for the total synchronicity of man and machine, the perfect combination of style, efficiency and speed."

One Mountain Thousand Summits reveals the true story of the K2 tragedy that claimed the lives of eleven men. Based on his numerous trips to Nepal and in-depth interviews he conducted with the survivors, the families of the lost climbers, and the Sherpa guides whose heroic efforts saved the lives of at least four climbers, Freddie Wilkinson's narrative uncovers what actually occurred on the mountain, while delivering a criticism of the mainstream press's incomplete coverage of the event, and an insightful look into the lives of the six Sherpas who were involved."

Such provocative assertions are characteristic of this stimulating and informative guide, written in a highly personal and unique style by a noted painter and teacher. Brimming with pertinent insights into the technical aspects and painting in oils, it is also designed to help students perfect powers of observation and expression.
Harold Speed has distilled years of painting and pedagogical experience into an expert instructional program covering painting technique, painting from life, materials (paints, varnishes, oils and mediums, grounds, etc.), a painter's training, and more. Especially instructive is his extensive and perceptive discussion of form, tone, and color, and a fascinating series of detailed ""Notes"" analyzing the painting styles of Velasquez, Reynolds, Gainsborough, Franz Hals, and Rembrandt.
Nearly 70 photographs and drawings illustrate the text, among them prehistoric cave paintings, diagrams of tonal values, stages of portrait painting, and reproductions of masterpieces by Giotto, Vermeer, Ingres, Rembrandt, Titian, Reynolds, Gainsborough, Hals, Giorgione, Poussin, Corot, Veronese, and other luminaries. In addition to these pictorial pleasures, the author further leavens the lessons with thought-provoking opinion.
Clear, cogent, and down-to-earth, this time-honored handbook will especially interest serious amateurs studying the technical aspects of oil painting, but its rich insight into the mind and methods of the artist will enlighten and intrigue any art lover."

The Pulitzer Prize-winning Maus tells the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Jewish survivor of Hitler's Europe, and his son, a cartoonist coming to terms with his father's story. Maus approaches the unspeakable through the diminutive. Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews mice), shocks us out of any lingering sense of familiarity and succeeds in 'drawing us closer to the bleak heart of the Holocaust' (The New York Times).
Maus is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek's harrowing story of survival is woven into the author's account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. Against the backdrop of guilt brought by survival, they stage a normal life of small arguments and unhappy visits. This astonishing retelling of our century's grisliest news is a story of survival, not only of Vladek but of the children who survive even the survivors. Maus studies the bloody pawprints of history and tracks its meaning for all of us.

1895,"In The Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives",Steven Levy,Industries & Business Sectors (Books),"Computing, Internet & Digital Media",2.784617293,4,3,Hardcover,2011,Apr,"Written with full cooperation from top management, including cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, this is the inside story behind Google, the most successful and most admired technology company of our time, told by one of our best technology writers.

Few companies in history have ever been as successful and as admired as Google, the company that has transformed the Internet and become an indispensable part of our lives. How has Google done it? Veteran technology reporter Steven Levy was granted unprecedented access to the company, and in this revelatory book he takes readers inside Google headquarters‚Äîthe Googleplex‚Äîto show how Google works.

While they were still students at Stanford, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revolutionized Internet search. They followed this brilliant innovation with another, as two of Google‚Äôs earliest employees found a way to do what no one else had: make billions of dollars from Internet advertising. With this cash cow, Google was able to expand dramatically and take on other transformative projects: more efficient data centers, open-source cell phones, free Internet video (YouTube), cloud computing, digitizing books, and much more.

The key to Google‚Äôs success in all these businesses, Levy reveals, is its engineering mind-set and adoption of such Internet values as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk taking. After its unapologetically elitist approach to hiring, Google pampers its engineers‚Äîfree food and dry cleaning, on-site doctors and masseuses‚Äîand gives them all the resources they need to succeed. Even today, with a workforce of more than 23,000, Larry Page signs off on every hire.

But has Google lost its innovative edge? With its newest initiative, social networking, Google is chasing a successful competitor for the first time. Some employees are leaving the company for smaller, nimbler start-ups. Can the company that famously decided not to be evil still compete?

No other book has ever turned Google inside out as Levy does with In the Plex."

A metaphorical fugue on minds and machines in the spirit of Lewis Carroll

Douglas Hofstadter's book is concerned directly with the nature of ""maps"" or links between formal systems. However, according to Hofstadter, the formal system that underlies all mental activity transcends the system that supports it. If life can grow out of the formal chemical substrate of the cell, if consciousness can emerge out of a formal system of firing neurons, then so too will computers attain human intelligence.

A young art student at the time, hore witnessed the massive mobilization taking place in a network of villages and captured the widespread spirit of peasant consciousness and militant solidarity, all the more remarkable at a time when communalism was rife in National politics. Somnath hore‚Äôs personal diary and sketches of the tebhaga days are an unusual social document of a peasant movement seen through the eyes of a committed artist. Closely involved in the struggle, the tebhaga experience remained a source of inspiration for him. One can see in these sketches the rugged lines since transformed into sculptured forms, but charged with the same intensity of anguish and anger; and the seeds of the vision that infused his later work."

This first and only complete translation of Abol Tabol in more than 100 years manages to do both with consummate ease.
With amazingly rhyme-accurate rendering that reads as if the poems had been penned in the English language to begin with, this translation preserves every single rollicking rhyme and the exact same cadences as in the originals. Each translated poem is one hundred percent line-accurate and evokes immediate nostalgia of the original in both rhyme and rhythm.
Abol Tabol is, in fact, cleverly disguised socio-political satire, written to mock the state of society and administration of early 20th century colonial India. The book provides groundbreaking analysis, linking the poems to specific historical events and uncovering the targeted satire hidden in many of the poems. It answers questions like: Who is Katth Buro? Which scandal in English parliament is the poem Gondho Bichar about? Which Bengal-school painting is mocked in Bhooturey Khela? Which three Indian statesmen were the Ahlaadi in real life?
With a total of more than 250 pages, this is a book in two parts: the first comprises the translated poems and more than 40 illustrations. The second contains investigative analysis and some never-before-published commentary on the symbolism and hidden meanings woven skillfully into the poems. The analysis is beautifully clear, concise and logical, and cites more than 45 separate bibliographical references.
This book turns conventional wisdom about Sukumar Ray's Abol Tabol on its head, and irrevocably changes the understanding of this timeless work forever. A must-read for enthusiasts of humorous nonsense verse, as well as for academicians and students engaged in comparative literature and South Asian literature studies."

1967,Shortest Way Home: One mayor's challenge and a model for America's future,Pete Buttigieg,Government (Books),Politics,2.77815125,5,1,Paperback,2019,Jun,"'The best American political biography since Obama's Dreams from My Father' Guardian

NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER

A mayor's inspirational story of a Midwest city that has become nothing less than a blueprint for the future of American renewal.
Once described by the Washington Post as ""the most interesting mayor you've never heard of,"" Pete Buttigieg, the thirty-seven-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has now emerged as one of America's most visionary politicians. With soaring prose that celebrates a resurgent American Midwest, Shortest Way Home narrates the heroic transformation of a ""dying city"" (Newsweek) into nothing less than a shining model of urban reinvention.
Elected at twenty-nine as the nation's youngest mayor, Pete Buttigieg immediately recognized that ""great cities, and even great nations, are built through attention to the everyday."" As Shortest Way Home recalls, the challenges were daunting?whether confronting gun violence, renaming a street in honor of Martin Luther King Jr., or attracting tech companies to a city that had appealed more to junk bond scavengers than serious investors. None of this is underscored more than Buttigieg's audacious campaign to reclaim 1,000 houses, many of them abandoned, in 1,000 days and then, even as a sitting mayor, deploying to serve in Afghanistan as a Navy officer. Yet the most personal challenge still awaited Buttigieg, who came out in a South Bend Tribune editorial, just before being reelected with 78 percent of the vote, and then finding Chasten Glezman, a middle-school teacher, who would become his partner for life.
While Washington reels with scandal, Shortest Way Home, with its graceful, often humorous, language, challenges our perception of the typical American politician. In chronicling two once-unthinkable stories?that of an Afghanistan veteran who came out and found love and acceptance, all while in office, and that of a revitalized Rust Belt city no longer regarded as ""flyover country"" Buttigieg provides a new vision for America's shortest way home."

Jason Stanley understood this as a scholar of philosophy and propaganda and as the child of refugees of WWII Europe, but even he was surprised by its prevalence in the United States. First with the rise of the birther movement and later the ascent of Donald Trump, he observed that not only is the rise of fascist politics possible in America, but its roots have been here for more than a century. Drawing on history, philosophy, sociology, critical race theory, and examples from around the world from 19th-century America to 20th-century Germany (where Hitler was inspired by the Confederacy and Jim Crow South) to 21st-century India--Stanley identifies the ten pillars of fascist politics that leaders use to hold onto power by dividing populations into an us and a them: the mythic past, propaganda, anti-intellectualism, unreality, hierarchy, victimhood, law and order, sexual anxiety, appeals to the heartland, and a dismantling of public welfare and unity. He uncovers urgent patterns that are widespread today and pins down a creeping sense that fascist tendencies are on the rise. By recognizing them, he argues, readers might begin to resist their most harmful effects."
562,The Artist: Being Iniesta,Andr√©s Iniesta,Biographies & Autobiographies (Books),Sports,2.77815125,4.9,10,Paperback,2016,Sep,"Andr√©s Iniesta is the Barcelona and Spain legend, rated by the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Paul Scholes as one of the greatest footballers of all time. This is the thinking fan's footballer with a thinking fan's football book.
Andr√©s Iniesta was twelve years old when scouts invited him into Barcelona's famous La Masia academy. Shortly after he joined the club, Barca legend Pep Guardiola remarked of him, 'This lad is going to retire us all.'
Iniesta rapidly became a permanent fixture in the Barca midfield, propelling the club to a raft of trophies, including eight La Liga championships and four Champions League titles. With his country he has won the European Championship twice, and scored the winning goal in the 2010 World Cup final.
Behind the wonderfully graceful passing and movement, and the accolades and trophies he has garnered, there exists an intelligent and thoughtful man who, until now, has let his beautifully skilful feet do the talking. In The Artist: Being Iniesta, the Spanish maestro paints a vivid self-portrait, in his own words but also in those of his coaches, team-mates, opponents, friends and family. The result is intriguing."

1912,Never Grow Up,Jackie Chan,Action & Adventure (Books),Action & Adventure,2.77815125,4.9,12,Paperback,2018,Dec,"Everyone knows Jackie Chan. Whether it's from Rush Hour, Shanghai Noon, The Karate Kid, or Kung Fu Panda, Jackie is admired by generations of moviegoers for his acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, and mind-bending stunts. In 2016-after fifty-six years in the industry, over 200 films, and many broken bones-he received an honorary Academy Award for his lifetime achievement in film. But at 64 years-old, Jackie is just getting started. Now, in Never Grow Up, the global superstar reflects on his early life, including his childhood years at the China Drama Academy (in which he was enrolled at the age of six), his big breaks (and setbacks) in Hong Kong and Hollywood, his numerous brushes with death (both on and off film sets), and his life as a husband and father (which has been, admittedly and regrettably, imperfect). Jackie has never shied away from his mistakes. Since The Young Master in 1980, Jackie's films have ended with a bloopers reel in which he stumbles over his lines, misses his mark, or crashes to the ground in a stunt gone south. In Never Grow Up, Jackie applies the same spirit of openness to his life, proving time and time again why he's beloved the world over: he's honest, funny, kind, brave beyond reckoning and-after all this time-still young at heart."

My science book of the year.' Robin McKie, Observer, 'Best Books of 2018' She Has Her Mother‚Äôs Laugh presents a profoundly original perspective on what we pass along from generation to generation. Charles Darwin played a crucial part in turning heredity into a scientific question, and yet he failed spectacularly to answer it. The birth of genetics in the early 1900s seemed to do precisely that. Gradually, people translated their old notions about heredity into a language of genes. As the technology for studying genes became cheaper, millions of people ordered genetic tests to link themselves to missing parents, to distant ancestors, to ethnic identities . . . But, Zimmer argues, heredity isn‚Äôt just about genes that pass from parent to child. Heredity continues within our own bodies, as a single cell gives rise to trillions of cells that make up our bodies. We say we inherit genes from our ancestors ‚Äì using a word that once referred to kingdoms and estates ‚Äì but we inherit other things that matter as much or more to our lives, from microbes to technologies we use to make life more comfortable. We need a new definition of what heredity is and, through Carl Zimmer‚Äôs lucid exposition and storytelling, this resounding tour de force delivers it. Weaving together historical and current scientific research, his own experience with his two daughters, and the kind of original reporting expected of one of the world‚Äôs best science journalists, Zimmer ultimately unpacks urgent bioethical quandaries arising from new biomedical technologies, but also long-standing presumptions about who we really are and what we can pass on to future generations."

'All of us face hard choices in our lives,' Hillary Rodham Clinton writes at the start of this personal chronicle of years at the centre of world events. 'Life is about making such choices.

Curbed in the decades after World War II, it has recently returned with a vengeance. We all know the scale of the problem--talk about the 99% and the 1% is entrenched in public debate--but there has been little discussion of what we can do but despair. According to the distinguished economist Anthony Atkinson, however, we can do much more than skeptics imagine.

'A rich, entertaining and candid memoir. And overall Obama's a fun person to sit alongside as she tells you the story of her life . . . it is as beautifully written as any piece of fiction' i
In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America - the first African-American to serve in that role - she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.
In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her - from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world's most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it - in her own words and on her own terms.

Scandinavian Blanc is different from Scandinavian Noir: there is nothing noir about the world of Ulf Varg, a detective in the Sensitive Crimes Department in the Swedish city of Malmo. Ulf is concerned with very odd, but not too threatening crimes - injuries to the back of the knee caused by an unknown hand, young women who allow their desperation for a boyfriend to get the better of them, and peculiar goings-on in a spa on Sweden's south coast.
Of course, Ulf is a Swedish detective, and Swedish detectives, by convention, lead lives beset with problems of one sort or another. For a start, there is his name: Ulf derives from the Old Norse word for wolf and Varg means wolf in modern Swedish. But his character is far from vulpine: Ulf is a sympathetic, well-educated, and likeable man, with a knowledge of and interest in Nordic art. He has a dog called Marten, the only dog in Sweden who is capable of lip-reading (but only in Swedish). Martin becomes depressed and needs treatment. Dogs in Sweden are, apparently, particularly prone to Seasonal Affective Disorder. But this is summer - and there must be something else going on.
Ulf has a number of colleagues into whose lives we gain an insight. There is Anna, married to an anaesthetist, but very fond of Ulf; there is Erik, whose sole interest is fishing; Carl, whose father has written a book on the Danish philosopher, Kierkegaard; and there is poor Blomquist, from the uniformed branch, who goes on and on about health issues but who seems to have extraordinary luck in investigations. There is also Ulf's psychotherapist, Dr Svensson, whose observations on Ulf's life - and many other topics - enlightens - or possibly confuses.
Mister Varg introduces us to the world of this typically Scandinavian character and his friends and colleagues. Further adventures are planned."

An ardent reader of sentimental novels, she longs for passion and seeks escape in fantasies of high romance, in voracious spending and, eventually, in adultery. But even her affairs bring her disappointment and devastating consequences. Flaubert's erotically charged and psychologically acute portrayal of Emma Bovary caused a moral outcry on its publication in 1857. It was deemed so lifelike that many women claimed they were the model for his heroine; but Flaubert insisted: ""Madame Bovary, c'est moi.""

3278,The Ambassador's Club : The Indian Diplomat At Large,K. V. Rajan,Government (Books),Politics,2.747411808,4.5,12,Hardcover,2012,May,"In 1972, in what appeared a whimsical decision at first, Idi Amin, the dictator of Uganda, declared that all Asians holding citizenship of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh or the UK would be expelled from the country within three months. As he put it, mistakenly, 'Asians milked the cow, but did not feed it to yield more milk.' It was the beginning of a nightmarish five months for Niranjan Desai, who had been sent from India as officer on special duty to help tackle the crisis, as he tried to help people leaving possessions and attachments behind for an uncertain future, watched a country in turmoil where people vanished overnight, and was himself declared persona non grata and put at some risk to his life. But as he learnt from the experience, rules and regulations are secondary and merely a guide while helping people in distress. Sometimes, when there is no opportunity for the observance of diplomatic niceties, it is common sense that counts. The role of the Indian diplomat is a varied one, as Desai's and other'S accounts in The Ambassador's Club show, and Krishna V. Rajan, himself a skilful diplomat, has brought together, for the first time, a selection of experiences that shows the Indian Foreign Service in a remarkable new light. With a fine sense of observation and considerable writing skills, the contributions included here show the Indian envoy playing protector, negotiator and guide in places as far away as Chile and Fiji to closer home, in Bhutan and Nepal. Ranged here is the entire gamut of diplomatic duties, from putting forward the Indian viewpoint at tough negotiations on climate change to being the UN secretary-general's special envoy in Iraq in the time leading up to the war there; from being in a sensitive position as envoy in Fiji during a coup to being present as the Shimla Agreement was reached between India and Pakistan. 'It's a boy!' was the excited announcement of that accord. It is that same pleasure of accomplishment that runs through this anthology."

Krishna, one of the foremost Karnatik vocalists today, begins his panoramic exploration of that tradition with a fundamental question: what is music? Taking nothing for granted and addressing diverse readers from Karnatik music's rich spectrum and beyond it, Krishna provides a path-breaking overview of south Indian classical music. He advances provocative ideas about various aspects of its practice. Central to his thinking is the concept of 'art music', the ability to achieve abstraction, as the foundational character of Karnatik music. In his explorations, he sights the visible connections and unappreciated intersections between this music form and others - Hindustani music, Bharatanatyam, fusion music and cine music - treading new, often contentious, ground."

This is not that story.
Rand Fishkin, the founder and former CEO of Moz, is one of the world's leading experts on seo. Moz is now a dollar 45 million a year business, but Fishkin's business and reputation took 15 years to grow and his start-up began not in a Harvard dorm room but as a mother-and-son family business that fell deeply into debt.
Now fishkin pulls back the curtain on tech start-up mythology, exposing the ups and downs of start-up life that most ceos would rather keep secret. For instance, a minimally viable product can be destructive if you launch at the wrong moment. Growth hacking may be the buzzword du jour, but initiatives to your business can fizzle quickly. Revenue and profitability won't protect you from layoffs. and venture capital always comes with strings attached.
In lost and founder Fishkin reveals the mostly awful, sometimes awesome truth about start-up culture with the transparency and humour that his hundreds of thousands of blog readers have come to love. Fishkin's hard-won lessons are applicable to any kind of business environment and this book can help solve your problems and make you feel less alone for having them."

Ambedkar as the most powerful advocate of equality and fraternity in modern India. While the vibrant Dalit movement recognizes Ambedkar as an agent for social change, the intellectual class has celebrated him as the key architect of the Indian Constitution and the political establishment has sought to limit his concerns to the question of reservations. This remarkable volume seeks to unpack the radical in Ambedkar's legacy by examining his life work from hitherto unexplored perspectives.
Although revered by millions today primarily as a Dalit icon, Ambedkar was a serious scholar of India's history, society and foreign policy. He was also among the first dedicated human rights lawyers, as well as a journalist and a statesman.

5133,The Lost Tarot of Nostradamus Kit,John Matthews,Mental & Spiritual Healing,"Arts, Film & Photography",2.745074792,4.4,52,Paperback,2016,Oct,"This pack contains 78 full-color tarot cards as well as an illustrated instructional booklet.

In 1994 a researcher working in the Italian National Library in Rome discovered a manuscript containing 80 mysterious paintings, believed to have been devised by the mysterious prophet Michael de Nostredame, better known as Nostradamus. The manuscript, never published in his lifetime, was handed down to his son who later presented it to Pope Urban VIII. After that, it remained forgotten and neglected.

A brief glance at these extraordinary images shows how heavily they draw on the symbolism of Tarot. It is the belief of Tarot experts, Matthews and Kinghan, that Nostradamus was designing his own set of cards, drawing upon the visionary insights gleaned from his prophetic writings and visions. Now this Tarot has been brought to fruition by two modern experts and its secrets revealed for the first time.

Visionary artist Wil Kinghan and New York Times best-selling author and longtime student of Tarot, John Matthews have devised a deck which incorporates Nostradamus' images, fully updated to make what will inevitably be judged one of the most important decks of this age."

He inspired and enraged, challenged and delighted millions of men and women around the world. He lived almost entirely in the shadow of the British Raj, which for much of his life seemed a permanent fact, but which he did more than anyone else to bring down. In a world defined by violence and warfare and by fascist and communist dictatorships, he was armed with nothing more than his arguments and example. While fighting for national freedom, he also attacked caste and gender hierarchies, and fought (and died) for inter-religious harmony.
This magnificent book tells the story of Gandhi's life from his departure from South Africa to his dramatic assassination in 1948. It has a Tolstoyan sweep, showing us Gandhi as he was understood by his contemporaries, with new readings of his arguments with (among others) Ambedkar, Jinnah, and Churchill, and new insights on our freedom movement and its many strands. Drawing on never-before-seen sources and animated by its author's wonderful sense of drama and politics, Gandhi: The Years That Changed the World is the most ambitious book on the father of the nation."

Jerusalem is the universal city, the capital of two peoples, the shrine of three faiths; it is the prize of empires, the site of Judgement Day and the battlefield of today's clash of civilizations. From King David to Barack Obama, from the birth of Judaism, Christianity and Islam to the Israel-Palestine conflict, this is the epic history of 3,000 years of faith, slaughter, fanaticism and coexistence.
How did this small, remote town become the Holy City, the 'centre of the world' and now the key to peace in the Middle East? In a gripping narrative, Simon Sebag Montefiore reveals this ever-changing city in its many incarnations, bringing every epoch and character blazingly to life. Jerusalem's biography is told through the wars, love affairs and revelations of the men and women - kings, empresses, prophets, poets, saints, conquerors and whores - who created, destroyed, chronicled and believed in Jerusalem.
Drawing on new archives, current scholarship, his own family papers and a lifetime's study, Montefiore illuminates the essence of sanctity and mysticism, identity and empire in a unique chronicle of the city that many believe will be the setting for the Apocalypse. This is how Jerusalem became Jerusalem, and the only city that exists twice - in heaven and on earth."

In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America - the first African-American to serve in that role - she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments.

A Time Magazine ‚ÄúBest Comix of the Year‚Äù
A San Francisco Chronicle and Los Angeles Times Best-seller

Wise, funny, and heartbreaking, Persepolis is Marjane Satrapi‚Äôs graphic memoir of growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution.

In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah‚Äôs regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran‚Äôs last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country.

Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life. Marjane‚Äôs child‚Äôs-eye view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, Persepolis is at once a story of growing up and a reminder of the human cost of war and political repression. It shows how we carry on, with laughter and tears, in the face of absurdity. And, finally, it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom we cannot help but fall in love."

Here is the continuation of her fascinating story. In 1984, Marjane flees fundamentalism and the war with Iraq to begin a new life in Vienna. Once there, she faces the trials of adolescence far from her friends and family, and while she soon carves out a place for herself among a group of fellow outsiders, she continues to struggle for a sense of belonging.

Finding that she misses her home more than she can stand, Marjane returns to Iran after graduation. Her difficult homecoming forces her to confront the changes both she and her country have undergone in her absence and her shame at what she perceives as her failure in Austria. Marjane allows her past to weigh heavily on her until she finds some like-minded friends, falls in love, and begins studying art at a university. However, the repression and state-sanctioned chauvinism eventually lead her to question whether she can have a future in Iran.

As funny and poignant as its predecessor, Persepolis 2 is another clear-eyed and searing condemnation of the human cost of fundamentalism. In its depiction of the struggles of growing up‚Äîhere compounded by Marjane‚Äôs status as an outsider both abroad and at home‚Äîit is raw, honest, and incredibly illuminating."

The Indian Test team‚Äôs journey to the top is a story best told through its greatest games: the epic victories in West Indies and England in the 1970s, the thrilling tied Test, and the now-immortalized Eden Gardens Test of 2001, culminating in a cascade of wins in overseas Tests in the 2000s. Through it all, the Indian fan stood with the team, obsessed, fervent and passionate. This is the story of 28 of India‚Äôs greatest Tests, told by two fans who‚Äôve followed the team meticulously since the late 1950s, staying up through radio commentaries late at night, newspaper reports, TV broadcasts, and following the team to stadiums across the country. It is the story of a billion people‚Äôs romance with a game, and about cricketers who won the hearts of millions across the world. From the heady years of the 1970s to the world-conquerors in the noughties, from the days of hope in the 1960s to the depths of despair in the 1990s, these 28 Tests, above all, represent Indian cricket‚Äôs finest moments."

Of the millions of words written about that unforgettable day when Al Qaeda attacked the western world, most have been from outsiders. New York Times reporters Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn have taken the more revealing approach - using real-life testimonies to report solely from the perspective of those inside the towers. 102 Minutes is the epic account of ordinary men and women whose lives were changed forever in this kamikaze act of terrorism. This unique book about unique people, includes incredible stories of bravery, courage and overcoming unbelievable odds. Immortalised in this non-fiction masterpiece are the construction manager and his colleagues who pried open the doors and saved dozens of people in the north tower; the police officer who was a few blocks away, filing his retirement papers, but grabbed his badge and sprinted to the buildings; the window washer stuck in a lift fifty floors up who used a squeegee to escape; and the secretaries who led an elderly man down eighty-nine flights of stairs.

Chance encounters, moments of grace, a shout across an office shaped these minutes, marking the border between fear and solace, staking the boundary between life and death. Crossing a bridge of voices to go inside the infernos, seeing cataclysm and herosim one person at a time, Dwyer and Flynn tell the affecting, authoritative saga of the men and women - the 12,000 who escaped and the 2,749 who perished at Ground Zero on September 11th 2001 - as they made 102 minutes count as never before."

The world has finally begun to take notice of the worst case of ethnic cleansing in recent history, but the Rohingya tragedy has been unfolding for decades, going back to 1948, when Myanmar became an independent nation. Azeem Ibrahim‚Äôs thoroughly researched book traces the history of the Rohingya people to show how they became one of the world‚Äôs most persecuted minorities. The Rohingyas are a Muslim group who live in Rakhine province in western Myanmar‚Äîa majority Buddhist country that refuses to recognise them as one of its ‚Äònational races‚Äô and has denied them citizenship in the country of their birth. They are deprived of basic rights such as access to health services, education and employment and legal protection. There have been credible reports of armed attacks, torture and rape by government forces and entire villages of the Rohingyas have been burned down. This important book documents the slow-motion genocide of the Rohingyas and exposes not only the culpability of the Buddhist clergy in fomenting the religious cleansing of Myanmar, but also the shocking culpability of successive governments, including the present regime presided over by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi."

Evans' The Coming of the Third Reich: How the Nazis Destroyed Democracy and Seized Power in Germany explores how the First World War, the Weimar Republic and the Great Depression paved the way for Nazi rule.
They started as little more than a gang of extremists and thugs, yet in a few years the Nazis had turned Germany into a one-party state and led one of Europe's most advanced nations into moral, physical and cultural ruin and despair.
In this consummate and compelling history, the first book in his acclaimed trilogy on the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, Richard Evans reveals how and why it happened, questions whether the rise of Hitler was inevitable and dramatically re-creates the maelstrom of disorder, economic disaster, violence and polarization that gave rise to the terror of the Third Reich.

338,The Music of the Primes,Marcus du Sautoy,Mathematics (Books),Humour,2.698970004,3.7,4,Paperback,2004,Sep,"The paperback of the critically-acclaimed popular science book by a writer who is fast becoming a celebrity mathematician.
Prime numbers are the very atoms of arithmetic. They also embody one of the most tantalising enigmas in the pursuit of human knowledge. How can one predict when the next prime number will occur? Is there a formula which could generate primes? These apparently simple questions have confounded mathematicians ever since the Ancient Greeks.
In 1859, the brilliant German mathematician Bernard Riemann put forward an idea which finally seemed to reveal a magical harmony at work in the numerical landscape. The promise that these eternal, unchanging numbers would finally reveal their secret thrilled mathematicians around the world. Yet Riemann, a hypochondriac and a troubled perfectionist, never publicly provided a proof for his hypothesis and his housekeeper burnt all his personal papers on his death.
Whoever cracks Riemann's hypothesis will go down in history, for it has implications far beyond mathematics. In business, it is the lynchpin for security and e-commerce. In science, it has critical ramifications in Quantum Mechanics, Chaos Theory, and the future of computing. Pioneers in each of these fields are racing to crack the code and a prize of $1 million has been offered to the winner. As yet, it remains unsolved.
In this breathtaking book, mathematician Marcus du Sautoy tells the story of the eccentric and brilliant men who have struggled to solve one of the biggest mysteries in science. It is a story of strange journeys, last-minute escapes from death and the unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Above all, it is a moving and awe-inspiring evocation of the mathematician's world and the beauties and mysteries it contains."

A radical rethinking of what ISIS is and what it really wants
From Graeme Wood, author of the explosive Atlantic cover story ""What ISIS Really Wants,"" comes the definitive book on the history, psychology, character, and aims of the Islamic State. Based on Wood's unprecedented access to supporters, recruiters, and high-ranking members of the most infamous jihadist group in the world, The Way of the Strangers is a riveting, fast-paced deep dive into the apocalyptic dogma that informs the group's worldview, from the ideas that motivate it, to the ""fatwa factory"" that produces its laws, to its very specific plans for the future. By accepting that ISIS truly believes the end is nigh, we can understand its strategy-and predict what it will do next."

'Arthashastra' is one of the oldest books with immense historical significance written by Kautilya or Arya Chanakya as he was popularly known. This book is one of the most effective books ever written on the art of statecraft and the science of everyday living. Originally written in Sanskrit, this is the English translation of the book which highlights the role of Government in the lives of people and the important responsibilities that it should carry. The book also speaks a great deal about economics; hence the name 'Arthashastra' has been used which is the Sanskrit translation of the word 'Economics'.
Broader Concepts
This book is basically a collection of 380 shlokas which have been written in prose. It is divided into 15 different sections for the better understanding of the readers. It suggests that there are certain things that a man should strive to achieve during his lifetime and material wealth is also one of them. The concept of this book is very broad in this sense and it not only talks about money, but also about the aspects of material security and the interests of people.
Arya Chanakya
Arya Chanakya or Kautilya who is speculated to be a Brahmin from South India, wrote this book around 150 A.D. He was the person who was responsible for the downfall off the Nanda Dynasty in South India and helped Chandragupta Maurya win the throne. Chanakya was a great strategist which is self-evident from the fact that he overthrew an empire. He has imparted all of his knowledge in this book.

Winter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King‚Äôs Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert‚Äôs name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow.

Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances.

Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Non-fiction 2011
Shortlisted for the Duff Cooper Prize 2011
Shortlisted for the Wellcome Trust Book Prize
In The Emperor of All Maladies, Siddhartha Mukherjee, doctor, researcher and award-winning science writer, examines cancer with a cellular biologist‚Äôs precision, a historian‚Äôs perspective, and a biographer‚Äôs passion. The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with - and perished from - for more than five thousand years.
The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience and perseverance, but also of hubris, arrogance and misperception, all leveraged against a disease that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out ‚Äòwar against cancer‚Äô. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories and deaths, told through the eyes of predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary.
From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave cut off her malignant breast, to the nineteeth-century recipient of primitive radiation and chemotherapy and Mukherjee‚Äôs own leukemia patient, Carla, The Emperor of All Maladies is about the people who have soldiered through toxic, bruising, and draining regimes to survive and to increase the store of human knowledge.

3711,The Fifth Risk,Michael Lewis,Political Ideologies (Books),Politics,2.696356389,3.5,9,Hardcover,2018,Oct,"""The election happened,"" remembers Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, then deputy secretary of the Department of Energy. ""And then there was radio silence."" Across all departments, similar stories were playing out: Trump appointees were few and far between; Those that did show up were shockingly uninformed about the functions of their new workplace. Some even threw away the briefing books that had been prepared for them.
Michael Lewis's brilliant narrative takes us into the engine rooms of a government under attack by its own leaders. In Agriculture the funding of vital programs like food stamps and school lunches is being slashed. Commerce may not have enough staff to conduct the 2020 Census properly. Over at Energy, where international nuclear risk is managed, it's not clear there will be enough inspectors to track and locate black market uranium before terrorists do.
Lewis finds the linchpins of the system-those public servants whose knowledge, dedication and proactivity keep the machinery running. And he asks them what keeps them up at night."

Since the complete works were published, the collection has only become more popular and has run into several editions after that. Sherlock Holmes is one of the most popular series in crime fiction.
All the stories and novels in this book are centered around the famous sleuth Sherlock Holmes and how he solved even the most difficult cases with his remarkable observation techniques, reasoning abilities, towering intellect and knowledge of forensic science.
Many times, he even had to disguise himself to get to the underlying truth. Although most of his stories are narrated by his friend and biographer Dr. Watson, two had been narrated by Holmes himself while two other stories had been written in third person.
Often referred to as an 'eccentric‚Äô and 'Bohemian‚Äô by his friend Dr. Watson due to his inability to keep up with his personal hygiene and cleanliness, Holmes is known for trashing myths at a time when modern technologies were still a distant dream.
The novels in this collection are The Valley of Fear, The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Sign of Four and A Study in Scarlet. The 56 stories have been divided into five books: the Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, the Return of Sherlock Holmes, the Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes and His Last Bow.
About the author:
A Scottish physician and an eminent writer, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle‚Äôs portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, a crime fiction icon in his detective series of the same name is known to be one of the path breaking and classical work in the history of English literature.

Homicidal Psycho Jungle Cat chronicles another segment of the multifarious adventures of this wild child and his faithful, but skeptical, friend. If the best cartoons compel readers to identify themselves within the funny frames, then all who enjoy Calvin and Hobbes are creative, imaginative, and ... bad, bad, bad! Calvin, the irascible little boy with the stuffed tiger who comes to life are a pair bound for trouble. Boring school lessons become occasions for death-defying alien air battles, speeding snow sled descents elicit philosophical discussions on the meaning of life, and Hobbe's natural inclination to pounce on his little friend wreaks havoc on Calvin's sense of security. Calvin's the kid we all wish we'd been. Sassy, imaginative, far more verbal than his parents can manage, Calvin is the quintessential bad boy -- and the boy we love to see. He terrorizes little Susie, offers ""Candid Opinions"" from a neighborhood stand, and questions his parents' authority. ""What assurance do I have that your parenting isn't screwing me up?"" he demands. Calvin and Hobbes manages to say what needs to be said about childhood and life: ""Eww, mud,"" says Calvin. ""Look at this gooshy, dirty, slimy, thick, wet mud ... Bleecch ... Talk about a kid magnet!"""

4189,That Good Night: Life and Medicine in the Eleventh Hour,Sunita Puri,Action & Adventure (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.681241237,5,1,Paperback,2019,Apr,"'A profound meditation on a problem many of us will face; worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Atul Gawande's Being Mortal' Kirkus
As the American born daughter of immigrants, Dr. Sunita Puri knew from a young age that the gulf between her parents' experiences and her own was impossible to bridge, save for two elements: medicine and spirituality. Between days spent waiting for her mother, an anesthesiologist, to exit the OR, and evenings spent in conversation with her parents about their faith, Puri witnessed the tension between medicine's impulse to preserve life at all costs and a spiritual embrace of life's temporality. And it was that tension that eventually drew Puri, a passionate but unsatisfied medical student, to palliative medicine - a new specialty attempting to translate the border between medical intervention and quality-of-life care.
Interweaving evocative stories of Puri's family and the patients she cares for, That Good Night is a stunning meditation on impermanence and the role of medicine in helping us to live and die well, arming readers with information that will transform how we communicate with our doctors about what matters most to us.

Pillsbury shows how American policy make Rs have been wilfully blind to these developments for decades--and he includes himself in that critique, as he was once a leading voice in favour of aiding China. He also calls for the United States to design a new, more competitive strategy toward China as it really is, and not as we might wish it to be.

A couple of thousand feet above the tiny canvas tent the summit of the world's highest mountain stood impassively, waiting for someone to have the courage to approach. Inside the ice-crusted shelter, two forms lay still as death. Then there was a groan, a stirring and eventually the slow scratch of match against sandpaper. Low voices shared the high-altitude agonies of waking, the heating of water and the struggle with frozen boots. As the sun rose through wisps of cloud beyond the Tibetan hills to the east, one of the men emerged through the tent flaps. It was a fine morning for the attempt, with only a few clouds in the sky. The two of them stood for a while, shuffling their feet and blowing into their hands. Inside the tent lay a mess of sleeping bags and food. The men lifted oxygen sets onto their backs, then they turned towards the mountain and stamped off into history. On the 6th June, 1924, George Mallory and Sandy Irvine disappeared into the mists of history. George Mallory's body was discovered high on Everest in 1999. Sandy Irvine's body is still believed to be on the mountain having been rediscovered in 1975 by a Chinese climber who was killed the very next day. Combining personal experience, the physical evidence found on the mountain and an insight into the hearts and minds of the two climbers, Graham Holland produces the most compelling description of what actually happened on that day and the answer to that most intriguing of questions did they actually climb Everest?"

Reeling from a recent breakup and with only limited savings from her pub job, a tent, a few clothes and some tools, all packed on the back of her bike, she was determined to prove herself. She had ridden bikes since her teens and was well travelled. But nothing could prepare her for what lay ahead. When she returned to London nearly two and a half years later she was stones lighter and decades wiser. She'd ridden through unforgiving landscapes and countries ravaged by war, witnessed civil uprisings that forced her to fake documents, and fended off sexual attacks, biker gangs and corrupt police convinced she was trafficking drugs. She'd survived life-threatening illnesses, personal loss and brutal accidents that had left permanent scars and a black hole in her memory. And she'd fallen in love with two very different men. In an age before email, the internet, mobile phones, satnavs and, in some parts of the world, readily available and reliable maps, Elspeth achieved something that would still seem remarkable today. Told with honesty and wit, this is the extraordinary and moving story of a unique and life-changing adventure."

The book examines issues like identity, the looming water crisis, the perilous state of education, the economic meltdown and the danger of an unrealized 'demographic dividend' that have been eating the innards of Pakistan since its creation. It looks back at the Pakistan movement, where the seeds of many current problems were sown - the opportunistic use of religion being the most lethal of these. Pakistan: Courting the Abyss questions the flawed prescriptions and responses of successive governments, especially during military rule, to these critical challenges that have brought Pakistan to an abyss where it risks multi-organ failure, unless things change dramatically in the near future."

Moeen traces his journey from backyard cricket to the county game and his first-class debut as a teenager, through to his international debut at the relatively late age of 27 and the golden summer of 2017, when he was anointed Player of the Series against South Africa with thousands of England fans chanting his name.
But cricket is just one part of Moeen's life. His upbringing in the tough Sparkhill neighbourhood of Birmingham and the awakening at eighteen that led him to become a devout Muslim have given him a social conscience unusual for an elite athlete but have also attracted controversy. Here, for the first time, Moeen tells his side of the story.
Talented, tenacious and thoughtful, Moeen Ali is a true all-rounder."
1990,The Paradoxical Prime Minister,Shashi Tharoor,Political Ideologies (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.663700925,2.7,279,Hardcover,2018,Oct,"Narendra Modi is a paradoxical man. He says one thing and does another. He gives voice to a number of liberal ideas (such as the constitution being his holy book and sab ka saath, sab ka vikas), while at the same time pandering to some of the most illiberal elements in Indian society, on whom he depends for political support. Another paradox is how a Prime Minister who prides himself on effective governance has, through his silence, appeared to condone the worst aspects of misgovernance‚Äîcommunal riots, lynching's, the violence of gau-rakshaks and so on. A third paradox is his talk of soaring ambitions for the country when his government‚Äôs performance is underwhelming. So who is the real Narendra Modi? A noble, selfless leader who acts effectively in the interests of all his countrymen or an autocratic, right-wing bigot who is interested only in power and converting plural India into a Hindu Rashtra? Or something in between? This brilliant study of Modi and the effect he has had on our country answers these and other questions about a leader who is reviled and worshipped in equal measure. The book is divided into five sections comprising fifty chapters. The first section takes a close look at Modi‚Äôs life and times. The other four sections look at key aspects of the way in which Modi‚Äôs government functions and the lasting and often deleterious impact it has had on Indian society, major institutions, the economy, foreign policy and our fundamental values. Using years of close observation, personal encounters with Modi, considerable scholarship, a deep understanding of Indian politics and an insider‚Äôs view of the way in which government functions. Shashi Tharoor has stitched together a compelling portrait of this paradoxical figure. Never before has there been such a superbly written and devastatingly accurate account of the most controversial prime minister India has ever had."

1581,Modern South India: A History from the 17th Century to Our Times,Rajmohan Gandhi,Political Theory (Books),"Language, Linguistics & Writing",2.6599162,4.3,12,Hardcover,2018,Dec,"The sounds and flavours of the land south of the Vindhyas‚Äîtemple bells, coffee and jasmine, coconut and tamarind, delicious dosais and appams‚Äîare familiar to many, but its history is relatively unknown. In this monumental study, the first in over fifty years, historian and biographer Rajmohan Gandhi brings us the South Indian story in modern times. At heart, the story he tells is one of four powerful cultures‚ÄîKannada, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu, as well as the cultures‚ÄîKodava, Konkani, Marathi, Oriya, Tulu and indigenous‚Äîthat have influenced them.
When the narrative begins at the end of the sixteenth century, the Deccan sultanates of Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Golconda and Bidar have combined to defeat the kingdom of Vijayanagara, one of the last great medieval empires of the South. After the fall of Vijayanagara, less powerful nayakas or sultans ruled the region. Competition raged between these rulers and the many European trading companies. By the seventeenth century, only the French and British remained to fight it out, in association with Indian rulers and princely states.
The eighteenth century saw the growth of the kingdom of Mysore, first under Haidar Ali, a military leader who had briefly served the Nawab of Arcot, and then under his son Tipu Sultan, who annexed parts of present-day Tamil Nadu and Kerala. By now the European presence was growing strong and assertive. And with the fall of Tipu in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War at the end of the eighteenth century, the British East India Company (now the sole European power in South India) consolidated its holdings in the South.
In the nineteenth century, power changed hands from the private East India Company to the British monarchy‚ÄîQueen Victoria became the ‚ÄòEmpress of India‚Äô‚Äîand Britain continued consolidating its territory. Despite the tumultuous environment, this century also saw a creative outpouring.
The twentieth century saw a change in the relationship between the foreign ruler and the Indian citizenry. No longer content with isolated military campaigns led by rajas or nawabs, Indians expressed their urge for freedom through democratic outlets. National parties such as the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League and regional ones like the Justice Party, Andhra Mahajana Sabha, Dravida Kazhagam and others emerged. Prominent South Indian leaders such as Annie Besant, C. Rajagopalachari, E. V. Ramasami Naicker, Varadarajulu Naidu, K. Kamaraj, Annadurai, Kamaladevi, E. M. S. Namboodiripad, Potti Sriramulu and others took the fight to the British while, at the same time, carrying on campaigns to ensure the dignity of all citizens.
After Independence, new states were carved out from the former presidencies and princely states along linguistic lines‚ÄîTamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra. The book ends in the present, with a look at the new generation of political leaders who have taken over from dominant personalities like M. Karunanidhi, N. T. Rama Rao, M. G. Ramachandran, J. Jayalalithaa, K. Karunakaran and Ramakrishna Hegde. It also covers some of the most significant figures from other fields such as Narayana Guru, M. S. Subbulakshmi, U. R. Ananthamurthy, Dr Muthulakshmi Reddy and others.
A masterpiece in every sense of the word, Modern South India is a rich, authoritative and magnificent work of history about the South that will be read, debated and reflected upon for years to come."

1064,Strangers No More: New Narratives from India‚Äôs Northeast,Sanjoy Hazarika,Government (Books),Politics,2.654176542,3.5,9,Hardcover,2018,Jan,"Over twenty years ago, Sanjoy Hazarika‚Äôs first book on the Northeast, Strangers of the Mist, was published to immediate acclaim. Hailed as an exciting, path-breaking narrative on the region, it has been cited extensively in studies of Northeast India, used as a resource for scholars and journalists and adopted as course material in colleges.
Two decades later, in his new book, armed with more stories, interviews and research and after extensive travels through the region, Hazarika explains how and where things stand in the Northeast today. He examines old and new struggles, contemporary trends and the sweeping changes that have taken place and asks whether the region and its people are still ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô to the rest of India, to each other and whether they are destined to remain so. While it may not be possible to overcome lingering hatred, divisions and differences by brute force, economic might or efforts at cultural or political assimilation, there are other ways forward. These include the process of engagement of accepting, if not embracing, the ‚ÄòIdea of India‚Äô and working on forging connections between disparate cultures to overcome the mutual suspicions that have existed for decades. Hazarika tells little-known stories, drawn from personal experience and knowledge, of the way in which insurgents operate, of the reality of border towns in the region, the pain of victims and the courage of fighters on either side of the ideological and physical conflict, in the jungles and in lands awash with rain and swamped by mist. He travels across borders and mountains, listening to tales of the people of the region and those who live in neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar. He challenges the stereotype of the ‚ÄòNorth easterner‚Äô, critiques the categorization of the ‚ÄòBangladeshi‚Äô, deals with issues of ‚Äòrace and discrimination‚Äô and suggests best practices that could be used to deal with intractable issues and combatants. Critically, he tries to portray the way in which new generations are grappling with old and current issues with an eye to the future.

An idealized heroic tale about the struggle between good and evil, the Ramayana is also an intensely personal story of family relationships, love and loss, duty and honour, of harem intrigue, petty jealousies and destructive ambitions‚Äîall this played out in a universe populated by larger-than-life humans, gods and celestial beings, wondrous animals and terrifying demons.
Widely acclaimed since its first publication in 1996, Arshia Sattar‚Äôs stellar translation is an absolute delight, successfully bridging time and space to bring us the wisdom, adventure and eroticism of this enduring classic."

Born in the small city of Thal, Austria, in 1947, he moved to Los Angeles at the age of 21. Within ten years, he was a millionaire business man. After twenty years, he was the world's biggest movie star. In 2003, he was Governor of California and a household name around the world."
4049,The Road to Ruin,James Rickards,Governmental,Politics,2.644438589,4.1,13,Paperback,2016,Dec,"The global economy has made what seems like an incredible comeback after the financial crisis of 2008. Yet this comeback is artificial. Central banks have propped up markets by keeping interest rates low and the supply of money free-flowing. They won't bail us out again next time. And there will be a next time - soon.

In The Road to Ruin, bestselling author James Rickards identifies how governments around the world are secretly preparing an alternative strategy for the next big crisis: a lockdown. Instead of printing money to reliquify markets and prop up assets, governments are preparing to close banks, shut down exchanges and order powerful asset managers not to sell. They're putting provisions in place that will allow them to do so legally. What's more, the global elite has already started making their own preparations, including hoarding cash and hard assets.

When the next one comes, it will be the average investor who suffers most - unless he or she heeds Rickards' warning and prepares accordingly."
2716,Tintin in the Congo (Adventures of TinTin),Herg√©,Comics & Mangas (Books),Comics & Mangas,2.643452676,4.3,30,Hardcover,2017,Feb,"In this, the second of the Tintin books, the young reporter travels to Africa, unearthing a criminal diamond smuggling operation run by the American gangster Al Capone (who he will meet again in Tintin in America). Tintin au Congo was first published in book form in French in 1931. This translation by Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner, the original Tintin translators, includes a fascinating foreword describing the publication history of Tintin's African adventure and placing it in its historical context. In his portrayal of the Belgian Congo, the young Herg√© reflects the colonial attitudes of the time.. he depicted the African people according to the bourgeois, paternalistic stereotypes of the period - an interpretation that some of today's readers may find offensive."
3883,Rage Becomes Her,Soraya Chemaly,Action & Adventure (Books),Action & Adventure,2.643452676,5,1,Paperback,2018,Sep,"A conversation-shifting book urging 21st-century women to understand their anger, embrace its power, and use it as a tool for positive change 'How many women cry when angry because we've held it in for so long? How many discover that anger turned inward is depression? Soraya Chemaly's Rage Becomes Her will be good for women. After all, women have a lot to be angry about.' GLORIA STEINEM Women are angry, and it isn't hard to figure out why. We are underpaid, overworked, thwarted and diminished. The assertive among us are labelled bitches, while the expressive among us are considered shrill. We are told to stand down when we have an opinion and to calm down when we are fired up. And when we somehow manage to put one high heel-battered foot in front of the other despite all of this, we're asked if it would kill us to smile. We are mad as hell, and that's completely okay. Because contrary to the endless barrage of self-help rhetoric about anger management and letting go, the reality is that our rage is the most important resource we have as women, a force for creation rather than destruction, our sharpest tool against both personal and political oppression. Anger is not what gets in our way, it is our way. All we need to do is own it. This is a pitch perfect, engaging, and accessible credo written by one of today's most influential feminists. Analysing female anger as it relates to topics like self-worth, objectification, pain, care, fear, silence, and denial, Soraya illuminates how and why we repress our anger, revealing the harm that this causes, and helping us recognise the liberating power of owning our anger and marshalling it as a vital tool for positive change. Just as Quiet brought about a new embrace of introversion, Rage Becomes Her will bring about an embrace of feminine anger that will leave women feeling liberated, inspired and connected to an entire universe of women who are no longer interested in making nice."

It starts in the nineteenth century with Nusserwanji Tata - a middle-class Parsi priest from the village of Navsari in Gujarat, and widely regarded as the Father of Indian Industry - and ends with Ratan Tata - chairman of the Tata Group until 2012. But it is more than just a history of the industrial house; it is an inspiring account of India in the making. It chronicles how each generation of the family invested not only in the expansion of its own business interests but also in nation building. For instance, few know that the first hydel project in the world was conceived and built by the Tatas in India. Nor that some radical labour concepts such as eight-hour work shifts were born in India, at the Tata mill in Nagpur. The National Centre for the Performing Arts, the Tata Cancer Research Centre, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research - the list about the Tatas' contribution to India is a long one. A bestseller in Marathi when it was first published in 2015, this is the only book that tells the complete Tata story over two hundred years."

Ahead lay almost 2,200 miles of remote mountain wilderness filled with bears, moose, bobcats, rattlesnakes, poisonous plants, disease-bearing tics, the occasional chuckling murderer and - perhaps most alarming of all - people whose favourite pastime is discussing the relative merits of the external-frame backpack.

Facing savage weather, merciless insects, unreliable maps and a fickle companion whose profoundest wish was to go to a motel and watch The X-Files, Bryson gamely struggled through the wilderness to achieve a lifetime's ambition - not to die outdoors."

Along the way, Sasaki modestly shares his personal minimalist experience, offering tips on the minimizing process and revealing the profound ways in which he has changed since he got rid of everything he didn't truly need.

The Trilogy is three cleverly interconnected novels that exploit the elements of standard detective fiction and achieve a new genre that is all the more gripping for its starkness. It is a riveting work of detective fiction worthy of Raymond Chandler, and at the same time a profound and unsettling existentialist enquiry in the tradition of Kafka or Borges. In each story the search for clues leads to remarkable coincidences in the universe as the simple act of trailing a man ultimately becomes a startling investigation of what it means to be human. The New York Trilogy is the modern novel at its finest: a truly bold and arresting work of fiction with something to transfix and astound every reader. 'Marks a new departure for the American novel.'

When Hungarian professor Ern≈ë Rubik invented the Rubik‚Äôs Cube (or, rather, his Cube) in the 1970s out of wooden blocks, rubber bands, and paper clips, he didn‚Äôt even know if it could be solved, let alone that it would become the world‚Äôs most popular puzzle. Since its creation, the Cube has become many things to many people: one of the bestselling children‚Äôs toys of all time, a symbol of intellectual prowess, a frustrating puzzle with 43.2 quintillion possible permutations, and now a worldwide sporting phenomenon that is introducing the classic brainteaser to a new generation.

In Cracking the Cube, Ian Scheffler reveals that cubing isn‚Äôt just fun and games. Along with participating in speedcubing competitions‚Äîfrom the World Championship to local tournaments‚Äîand interviewing key figures from the Cube‚Äôs history, he journeys to Budapest to seek a meeting with the legendary and notoriously reclusive Rubik, who is still tinkering away with puzzles in his seventies.

Getting sucked into the competitive circuit himself, Scheffler becomes engrossed in solving Rubik‚Äôs Cube in under twenty seconds, the quasi-mystical barrier known as ‚Äúsub-20,‚Äù which is to cubing what four minutes is to the mile: the difference between the best and everyone else. For Scheffler, the road to sub-20 is not just about memorizing algorithms or even solving the Rubik‚Äôs Cube. As he learns from the many gurus who cross his path, from pint-sized kids to engineering professors, it‚Äôs about learning to solve yourself."

1798,The Attention Merchants,Tim Wu,Sales,"Computing, Internet & Digital Media",2.625312451,4.5,2,Paperback,2017,Nov,"Attention merchant: an industrial-scale harvester of human attention. A firm whose business model is the mass capture of attention for resale to advertisers. In nearly every moment of our waking lives, we face a barrage of advertising enticements, branding efforts, sponsored social media, commercials and other efforts to harvest our attention. Over the last century, few times or spaces have remained uncultivated by the 'attention merchants', contributing to the distracted, unfocused tenor of our times. Tim Wu argues that this is not simply the by-product of recent inventions but the end result of more than a century's growth and expansion in the industries that feed on human attention. From the pre-Madison Avenue birth of advertising to TV's golden age to our present age of radically individualized choices, the business model of 'attention merchants' has always been the same. He describes the revolts that have risen against these relentless attempts to influence our consumption, from the remote control to FDA regulations to Apple's ad-blocking OS. But he makes clear that attention merchants grow ever-new heads and their means of harvesting our attention have given rise to the defining industries of our time, changing our nature - cognitive, social and otherwise - in ways unimaginable even a generation ago."

So begins this epic, mesmerizing first novel set in the underworld of contemporary Bombay. Shantaram is narrated by Lin, an escaped convict with a false passport who flees maximum security prison in Australia for the teeming streets of a city where he can disappear.
Accompanied by his guide and faithful friend, Prabaker, the two enter Bombay's hidden society of beggars and gangsters, prostitutes and holy men, soldiers and actors, and Indians and exiles from other countries, who seek in this remarkable place what they cannot find elsewhere.
As a hunted man without a home, family, or identity, Lin searches for love and meaning while running a clinic in one of the city's poorest slums, and serving his apprenticeship in the dark arts of the Bombay mafia. The search leads him to war, prison torture, murder, and a series of enigmatic and bloody betrayals. The keys to unlock the mysteries and intrigues that bind Lin are held by two people. The first is Khader Khan: mafia godfather, criminal-philosopher-saint, and mentor to Lin in the underworld of the Golden City. The second is Karla: elusive, dangerous, and beautiful, whose passions are driven by secrets that torment her and yet give her a terrible power.
Burning slums and five-star hotels, romantic love and prison agonies, criminal wars and Bollywood films, spiritual gurus and mujaheddin guerrillas---this huge novel has the world of human experience in its reach, and a passionate love for India at its heart. Based on the life of the author, it is by any measure the debut of an extraordinary voice in literature."
1541,Awakening Bharat Mata: The Political Beliefs of the Indian Right,Swapan Dasgupta,Political Ideologies (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.624282096,3.5,2,Hardcover,2019,May,"The rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was much more than an ordinary electoral phenomenon: it brought to the fore two contrasting views of nationhood: between those who saw modern India in terms of secular republicanism and on the other hand were those who sought to blend technological modernity with the country's Hindu inheritance. The Right's ascendancy and the debates that accompanied it, anticipated many of the concerns that find reflection today in the United States and Europe.
The phenomenon of Hindu nationalism was also a profound intellectual challenge to the loose Left-liberal consensus that had prevailed in India since Jawaharlal Nehru became Prime Minister in 1947. The idea of Hindutva and the political character of the BJP have been closely scrutinised by scholars, and the impulse has been to view India's Right-wing politics as either a variant of fascism or merely a collection of sectarian prejudices.
In fact, the inspiration for the Right in India has come from multiple and often contradictory sources, including the influence of individuals such as Sarvarkar, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Swami Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo, not to mention the Arya Samaj movement.
This collection is an attempt to showcase the phenomenon of Hindu nationalism in terms of how it perceives itself. Many of the concerns that drive the Indian Right are located in the country's nationalist culture. In trying to locate some of the ideas, attitudes and beliefs that define the Indian Right, Awakening Bharat Mata also seeks to identify the nature of Indian conservatism and identify its similarities and differences with political thought in the West.
This book is not about Hindu nationalism in power but as a social and political movement and its aim is to encourage a more informed understanding of an idea that will remain relevant in Indian life far beyond victories and defeats in elections."

In a world that is forgetting the lessons history has to teach, this book is a reminder of the horrors that come from intolerance. 

In the 1930s, a great evil was rising in the heart of Europe, a threat unlike any seen before. German leader Adolf Hitler, a madman bent on world domination, was raising an army and growing more violent by the day. The world knew that Hitler had to be stopped. But fearing a war, this growing threat of Hitler's Nazi army was left unchecked. The world simply watched as Germany sank into darkness. The world merely prayed that war would not breach their borders. The world waited. And they waited too long.

As cities fell to ruin and millions were slaughtered, the growing darkness of Hitler and his Nazi empire branched out far beyond Europe‚Äîto Asia and Africa and America‚Äîand soon threatened to claim the entire world. France, England, Russia, the United States‚Ä¶ no single nation had the strength to combat this darkness, at least not on their own.

2912,Outnumbered: From Facebook and Google to Fake News and Filter-bubbles ‚Äì The Algorithms That Control Our Lives,David Sumpter,Action & Adventure (Books),"Computing, Internet & Digital Media",2.618048097,4.3,4,Paperback,2018,May,"Algorithms are running our society and we don't really know what they are up to.
Our increasing reliance on technology and the internet has opened a window for mathematicians and data researchers to gaze through into our lives. Using the data they are constantly collecting about where we travel, where we shop, what we buy and what interests us, they can begin to predict our daily habits. But how reliable is this data? Without understanding what mathematics can and can't do, it is impossible to get a handle on how it is changing our lives.
In this book, David Sumpter takes an algorithm-strewn journey to the dark side of mathematics. He investigates the equations that analyse us, influence us and will (maybe) become like us, answering questions such as:
How does Facebook build a 100-dimensional picture of your personality?
Are Google algorithms racist and sexist?
Why do election predictions fail so drastically?
Are algorithms that are designed to find criminals making terrible mistakes?
What does the future hold as we relinquish our decision-making to machines?
Featuring interviews with those working at the cutting edge of algorithm research along with a healthy dose of mathematical self-experiment, Outnumbered will explain how mathematics and statistics work in the real world, and what we should and shouldn't worry about.
A lot of people feel outnumbered by algorithms - don't be one of them."

- A new translation of Zinky Boys based on the revised text -
From 1979 to 1989 Soviet troops engaged in a devastating war in Afghanistan that claimed thousands of casualties on both sides. While the Soviet Union talked about a 'peace-keeping' mission, the dead were shipped back in sealed zinc coffins. Boys in Zinc presents the honest testimonies of soldiers, doctors and nurses, mothers, wives and siblings who describe the lasting effects of war.
Weaving together their stories, Svetlana Alexievich shows us the truth of the Soviet-Afghan conflict: the killing and the beauty of small everyday moments, the shame of returned veterans, the worries of all those left behind. When it was first published in the USSR in 1991, Boys in Zinc sparked huge controversy for its unflinching, harrowing insight into the realities of war."

‚ÄúBelongs on the shelf alongside other terrific books about this difficult subject, like Paul Kalanithi‚Äôs When Breath Becomes Air and Atul Gawande‚Äôs Being Mortal.‚Äù‚ÄîBill Gates

NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY REAL SIMPLE

Kate Bowler is a professor at Duke Divinity School with a modest Christian upbringing, but she specializes in the study of the prosperity gospel, a creed that sees fortune as a blessing from God and misfortune as a mark of God‚Äôs disapproval. At thirty-five, everything in her life seems to point toward ‚Äúblessing.‚Äù She is thriving in her job, married to her high school sweetheart, and loves life with her newborn son.

Then she is diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer.

The prospect of her own mortality forces Kate to realize that she has been tacitly subscribing to the prosperity gospel, living with the conviction that she can control the shape of her life with ‚Äúa surge of determination.‚Äù Even as this type of Christianity celebrates the American can-do spirit, it implies that if you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do‚Äù and succumb to illness or misfortune, you are a failure. Kate is very sick, and no amount of positive thinking will shrink her tumors. What does it mean to die, she wonders, in a society that insists everything happens for a reason? Kate is stripped of this certainty only to discover that without it, life is hard but beautiful in a way it never has been before.

Frank and funny, dark and wise, Kate Bowler pulls the reader deeply into her life in an account she populates affectionately with a colorful, often hilarious retinue of friends, mega-church preachers, relatives, and doctors. Everything Happens for a Reason tells her story, offering up her irreverent, hard-won observations on dying and the ways it has taught her to live.

Praise for Everything Happens for a Reason
 
‚ÄúI fell hard and fast for Kate Bowler. Her writing is naked, elegant, and gripping‚Äîshe‚Äôs like a Christian Joan Didion. I left Kate‚Äôs story feeling more present, more grateful, and a hell of a lot less alone. And what else is art for?‚Äù‚ÄîGlennon Doyle, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Love Warrior and president of Together Rising"
2901,Every Patient Tells a Story: Medical Mysteries and the Art of Diagnosis,Lisa Sanders,Physician & Patient,"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.608526034,4.6,26,Paperback,2010,Sep,"A riveting exploration of the most difficult and important part of what doctors do, by Yale School of Medicine physician Dr. Lisa Sanders, author of the monthly New York Times Magazine column ""Diagnosis,"" the inspiration for the hit Fox TV series House, M.D.

""The experience of being ill can be like waking up in a foreign country. Life, as you formerly knew it, is on hold while you travel through this other world as unknown as it is unexpected. When I see patients in the hospital or in my office who are suddenly, surprisingly ill, what they really want to know is, ‚ÄòWhat is wrong with me?‚Äô They want a road map that will help them manage their new surroundings. The ability to give this unnerving and unfamiliar place a name, to know it‚Äìon some level‚Äìrestores a measure of control, independent of whether or not that diagnosis comes attached to a cure. Because, even today, a diagnosis is frequently all a good doctor has to offer.""

A healthy young man suddenly loses his memory‚Äìmaking him unable to remember the events of each passing hour. Two patients diagnosed with Lyme disease improve after antibiotic treatment‚Äìonly to have their symptoms mysteriously return. A young woman lies dying in the ICU‚Äìbleeding, jaundiced, incoherent‚Äìand none of her doctors know what is killing her. In Every Patient Tells a Story, Dr. Lisa Sanders takes us bedside to witness the process of solving these and other diagnostic dilemmas, providing a firsthand account of the expertise and intuition that lead a doctor to make the right diagnosis.

Never in human history have doctors had the knowledge, the tools, and the skills that they have today to diagnose illness and disease. And yet mistakes are made, diagnoses missed, symptoms or tests misunderstood. In this high-tech world of modern medicine, Sanders shows us that knowledge, while essential, is not sufficient to unravel the complexities of illness. She presents an unflinching look inside the detective story that marks nearly every illness‚Äìthe diagnosis‚Äìrevealing the combination of uncertainty and intrigue that doctors face when confronting patients who are sick or dying. Through dramatic stories of patients with baffling symptoms, Sanders portrays the absolute necessity and surprising difficulties of getting the patient‚Äôs story, the challenges of the physical exam, the pitfalls of doctor-to-doctor communication, the vagaries of tests, and the near calamity of diagnostic errors. In Every Patient Tells a Story, Dr. Sanders chronicles the real-life drama of doctors solving these difficult medical mysteries that not only illustrate the art and science of diagnosis, but often save the patients‚Äô lives."

1701,Exactly: How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World,Simon Winchester,Astronomy (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.606381365,4.8,9,Paperback,2018,Jun,"Bestselling author Simon Winchester writes a magnificent history of the pioneering engineers who developed precision machinery to allow us to see as far as the moon and as close as the Higgs boson.

Precision is the key to everything. It is an integral, unchallenged and essential component of our modern social, mercantile, scientific, mechanical and intellectual landscapes. The items we value in our daily lives ‚Äì a camera, phone, computer, bicycle, car, a dishwasher perhaps ‚Äì all sport components that fit together with precision and operate with near perfection. We also assume that the more precise a device the better it is. And yet whilst we live lives peppered and larded with precision, we are not, when we come to think about it, entirely sure what precision is, or what it means. How and when did it begin to build the
modern world?

Simon Winchester seeks to answer these questions through stories of precision‚Äôs pioneers. Exactly takes us back to the origins of the Industrial Age, to Britain where he introduces the scientific minds that helped usher in modern production: John ‚ÄòIron-Mad‚Äô Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden and Joseph Whitworth. Thomas Jefferson exported their discoveries to the United States as manufacturing developed in the early twentieth century, with Britain‚Äôs Henry Royce developing the Rolls
Royce and Henry Ford mass producing cars, Hattori‚Äôs Seiko and Leica lenses, to today‚Äôs cutting-edge developments from Europe, Asia and North America.

As he introduces the minds and methods that have changed the modern world, Winchester explores fundamental questions. Why is precision important? What are the different tools we use to measure it? Who has invented and perfected it? Has the pursuit of the ultra-precise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old traditions of craftsmanship, art and high culture? Are we missing something that reflects the world as it is, rather than the world as we think we would wish it to be? And can the precise and the natural co-exist in society?"

Before 30 Rock, Mean Girls and 'Sarah Palin', Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher.
She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV. She has seen both these dreams come true.
At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on Saturday Night Live; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon - from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.

This highly original history offers a brilliant and simple unifying theory for our understanding the last two hundred years: the power of sheer numbers. An ambitious, original, magisterial history of modernity, it taps into prominent preoccupations of our day and will transform our perception of history for many years to come."

Anand Giridharadas sensed something was afoot as his plane from America prepared to land in Bombay. An elderly passenger looked at him and said, 'We're all trying to go that way,' pointing to the rear. 'You,' he added, as if seeking to alert him to a ticketing error, 'you're going this way?' Giridharadas was returning to India amid an unlikely economic boom. But he was interested less in its gold rush than in its cultural upheaval, as a new generation has sought to reconcile old traditions and customs with new ambitions and dreams. In India Calling, one of the most vivid and perceptive accounts of the country in recent memory, Giridharadas journeys through India, artfully documenting change and conflict through keenly observed stories. He writes of a dynamic low-caste man in a small town who pulls himself up into the new India; of a progressive urban woman torn between her desires and the wishes of her parents; of a lonely man in Punjab who clings to old notions of honour even as money replaces it as the currency of prestige; of a 'part-time' revolutionary who worked as a journalist by day and a Naxalite by night; of Mukesh Ambani, perhaps the most powerful private citizen of India, whose success speaks of an India free from its colonial baggage. Telling these stories through the prism of his own emigre family history and his childhood memories of India, Giridharadas shows how India is reinventing itself: how parents and children, husbands and wives, cousins and siblings are seizing hold of their destinies, bending the meaning of Indianness, and enduring the pangs of the old birthing the new. The result is this remarkable debut: an intimate portrait of a country becoming modern while striving to remain itself. Advance praise For India Calling '...an engrossing and acutely observed appreciation of a country that is at once old and new...' Amartya Sen 'Anand Giridharadas is more than just a widely admired journalist; with India Calling he has transformed into a fluent, witty, and intelligent writer. His very personal and perceptive look at the new India is a memorable debut, full of insight and diversion.' -William Dalrymple, author of Nine Lives: In Search of the Sacred in Modern India 'The emergence of a more dynamic India has been widely observed. Less well understood are the myriad reinventions that make the new India so exciting. In India Calling, Anand Giridharadas renders this change on an intimate scale with a tapestry of keenly observed stories about the changing dreams and frustrations of all walks of Indians - and his own. Savvy and often moving, India Calling is for those who prefer the view from the ground than from thirty thousand feet.' -Edward Luce, author of In Spite of the Gods: The Rise of Modern India 'Rarely has an author deciphered the Indian enigma the way Anand Giridharadas does in India Calling. By lucidly portraying the country's real locomotive - its vast and populous youth - he provides the most timely and elegant guide to perhaps the most important next generation in the world.' -Parag Khanna, author of The Second World and How to Run the World"

A woman has her throat cut behind a bar in Mississippi. Just down the road is a big army base. Is the murderer a local guy - or is he a soldier?

Jack Reacher, still a major in the military police, is sent in undercover.

The county sheriff is a former U.S. Marine - and a stunningly beautiful woman. Her investigation is going nowhere. Is the Pentagon stonewalling her? Or doesn't she really want to find the killer?

With The Warded Man and The Desert Spear, Peter V. Brett surged to the front rank of contemporary fantasy, standing alongside giants in the field such as George R. R. Martin, Robert Jordan, and Terry Brooks. The Daylight War, the eagerly anticipated third volume in Brett‚Äôs internationally bestselling Demon Cycle, continues the epic tale of humanity‚Äôs last stand against an army of demons that rise each night to prey on mankind.

On the night of the new moon, the demons rise in force, seeking the deaths of two men, both of whom have the potential to become the fabled Deliverer, the man prophesied to reunite the scattered remnants of humanity in a final push to destroy the demon corelings once and for all.

Arlen Bales was once an ordinary man, but now he has become something more‚Äîthe Warded Man, tattooed with eldritch wards so powerful they make him a match for any demon. Arlen denies he is the Deliverer at every turn, but the more he tries to be one with the common folk, the more fervently they believe. Many would follow him, but Arlen‚Äôs path threatens to lead to a dark place he alone can travel to, and from which there may be no returning.

The only one with hope of keeping Arlen in the world of men, or joining him in his descent into the world of demons, is Renna Tanner, a fierce young woman in danger of losing herself to the power of demon magic.

Ahmann Jardir has forged the warlike desert tribes of Krasia into a demon-killing army and proclaimed himself Shar‚ÄôDama Ka, the Deliverer. He carries ancient weapons‚Äîa spear and a crown‚Äîthat give credence to his claim, and already vast swaths of the green lands bow to his control.

But Jardir did not come to power on his own. His rise was engineered by his First Wife, Inevera, a cunning and powerful priestess whose formidable demon bone magic gives her the ability to glimpse the future. Inevera‚Äôs motives and past are shrouded in mystery, and even Jardir does not entirely trust her.

Once Arlen and Jardir were as close as brothers. Now they are the bitterest of rivals. As humanity‚Äôs enemies rise, the only two men capable of defeating them are divided against each other by the most deadly demons of all‚Äîthose lurking in the human heart.

When the children of his village were struck with a mysterious illness, Number Ten Ox sought a wiseman to save them. He found master Li Kao, a scholar with a slight flaw in his character. Together they set out to find the Great Root of Power, the only possible cure.

The quest led them to a host of truly memorable characters, multiple wonders, incredible adventures‚Äîand strange coincidences which were really not coincidences at all. And it involved them in an ancient crime that still perturbed the serenity of Heaven. Simply and charmingly told, this is a wry tale, a sly tale, and a story of wisdom delightfully askew. Once read, its marvels and beauty will not easily fade from the mind.

966,Buddha Four Encouters - Vol. 2,Osamu Tezuka,Mangas,Comics & Mangas,2.602059991,5,1,Paperback,2010,Oct,"The second book in the classic eight volume graphic novel series retelling the story of Buddha, from the godfather of the genre ‚Äì an irreverent and humourous rendition of the life and times of Prince Siddhartha.
In book two, The Four Encounters, Prince Siddartha ‚Äì fated to become the Buddha ‚Äì is confronted by the harsh penalties of social injustice within his own kingdom, fuelled by selfish warlords and villains like the depraved warrior, Bandaka. The tragic fortunes of his loved-ones, such as Tatta the rogue and Migalia the fierce female bandit, force the Prince to choose between love and destiny; Siddartha must forsake his heart and begin his pilgrimage.
Originated in the 1970s, Buddha is Osamu Tezuka's unparalleled rendition of the life and times of Prince Siddhartha.
Tezuka's storytelling genius and consummate skill at visual expression blossom fully as he contextualizes the Buddha's ideas; with an emphasis on, action, emotion, humour and conflict as Prince Siddhartha runs away from home, travels across India and questions Hindu practices such as ascetic self-mutilation and caste oppression.
Rather than recommend resignation and impassivity, Tezuka's Buddha predicates enlightenment upon recognizing the interconnectedness of life, having compassion for the suffering, and ordering one's life sensibly, his approach is slightly irreverent in that it incorporates something that Western commentators often eschew, namely, humour."

What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime?

Exploring how insights from computer algorithms can be applied to our everyday lives, ‚ÄòAlgorithms To Live By‚Äô helps to solve common decision-making problems and illuminate the workings of the human mind. When should you switch between different tasks and how many tasks should you take on in the first place? How much messiness should you accept? What balance of new activities and familiar favourites is the most fulfilling? When computers face constraints of time and space, they too must untangle very human questions: how to have better hunches, when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others. And the solutions they‚Äôve found have much to teach us.

Acclaimed author Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths show how the algorithms developed for computers can be applied from finding your spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing your inbox to understanding the workings of memory. Where you have a dilemma, they have a rule and each fascinating algorithm turns the wisdom of computer science into strategies for human living."

Opening with the enigmatic question 'Who is John Galt?', Atlas Shrugged envisions a world where the 'men of talent' - the great innovators, producers and creators - have mysteriously disappeared. With the US economy now faltering, businesswoman Dagny Taggart is struggling to get the transcontinental railroad up and running. For her John Galt is the enemy, but as she will learn, nothing in this situation is quite as it seems. Hugely influential and grand in scope, this story of a man who stopped the motor of the world expounds Rand's controversial philosophy of Objectivism, which champions competition, creativity and human greatness.
Ayn Rand (1905-82), born Alisa Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg, Russia, emigrated to America with her family in January 1926, never to return to her native land. Her novel The Fountainhead was published in 1943 and eventually became a bestseller. Still occasionally working as a screenwriter, Rand moved to New York City in 1951 and published Atlas Shrugged in 1957. Her novels espoused what came to be called Objectivism, a philosophy that champions capitalism and the pre-eminence of the individual.
If you enjoyed Atlas Shrugged, you might like Rand's The Fountainhead, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.

When brutal landowner Fyodor Karamazov is murdered, the lives of his sons are changed irrevocably: Mitya, the sensualist, whose bitter rivalry with his father immediately places him under suspicion for parricide; Ivan, the intellectual, whose mental tortures drive him to breakdown; the spiritual Alyosha, who tries to heal the family's rifts; and the shadowy figure of their bastard half-brother Smerdyakov. As the ensuing investigation and trial reveal the true identity of the murderer, Dostoyevsky's dark masterpiece evokes a world where the lines between innocence and corruption, good and evil, blur and everyone's faith in humanity is tested. This powerful translation of The Brothers Karamazov features and introduction highlighting Dostoyevsky's recurrent themes of guilt and salvation, with a new chronology and further reading. Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky (1821-1881) was born in Moscow. From 1849-54 he lived in a convict prison, and in later years his passion for gambling led him deeply into debt.

2681,Hali and Collected Stories,G.V. Desani,Contemporary Fiction (Books),Comics & Mangas,2.597695186,5,1,Hardcover,1998,Mar,"G.V. Desani broke his silence forty years after the appearance of his classic novel, All About H. Hatterr, with this volume of twenty-three stories and one long prose poem, only the second full-length book of his fiction ever to be published. Many of the stories appeared first in literary anthologies and magazines over the past thirty years, including The Noble Savage (edited by Saul Bellow), Illustrated Weekly of India, Transatlantic Review, and Boston University Journal. The stories are mostly written in the humorous mode of his novel, relying upon comic timing and his keen sense of the incongruities in contemporary life. They often captivate in the same way as Indres Shah's Sufi learning tales, and the titles alone convey a sense of the interpenetration of India's cultures: ""Suta Abandoned,"" ""Mephisto's Daughter,"" ""The Second Mrs. Was Wed in a Nightmare,"" ""Gypsy Jim Brazil to Kumari Kinshino,"" ""Country Life, Country Folk, Cobras, Thok,"" .."".Since Nation Must Export, Smithers,"" ""The Lama Arupa."" Whether send-ups of colonialism or lampoons of conventionality, there is a seriousness to Desani's comedy that crosses cultural boundaries and racial identification.
The long prose-poem, ""Hali,"" was originally issued in 1950, adapted for the stage in London, broadcast several times over BBC radio, and then, after being pirated three times, was suppressed by the author for twenty years until this publication. ""Hali"" is a complementary opposite to All About H. Hatterr: it is the writer's vision of cosmic creation and human destiny, marrying Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic and other Indian religious traditions into a cathartic drama. E.M. Forster said of it: ""Private mythologies are dangerous devices. You have succeeded wonderfully... It keeps evoking heights above the summit of normal achievement where the highest aspirations reach."" The Times Literary Supplement termed it ""haunting,"" and The Librarian declared it ""as near a work of genius as one can judge."" This is the definitive fourth edition, and also the first authorized U.S. publication of this work."

It is extraordinary how people employed by a trading company in a foreign land transformed into the most powerful Civil Service in the world. It was also the first Civil Service in the modern world where recruitment was on the basis of open competition and not through patronage. Though much criticized, it developed its own character and traditions. It is really unusual that such a service ‚Äì defined as the ‚ÄòSteel frame‚Äô, on which depended the fortunes and the survival of a huge empire ‚Äì continued essentially with the same structure and traditions, along with the administrative systems developed over a century, into independent democratic India. Although much has changed, even today the Indian Administrative service retains some basic characteristics from the past. This system of governance as it evolved in India is indeed fascinating story. Well researched and detailed in its presentation, Deepak Gupta looks at changes from the past, its present and also the future of the IAS. He also suggests some measures so that it could re-invent itself to play the important role envisaged by the makers of our Constitution."

A man punches the wall in a strategic show of anger. Another complains he has become a stranger to those he loves. A third relies on ‚Äúmy three a day: coffee, Nurofen and a bottle of wine.‚Äù Yet another admits he is an oddity, who would prefer to be working in cricket. A fifth describes his professional life as ‚Äúa circus‚Äù. These are football managers, live and uncut. Arsene Wenger likens the job to ‚Äúliving on a volcano: any day may be your last‚Äù. He speaks with the authority of being the longest serving manager in the English game, having been at Arsenal for 17 years. The average lifespan of a Football League manager is 17 months. Fifty three managers, across all four Divisions, were sacked, or resigned, in the 2012-13 season. There were fifty seven managerial changes in the 2013-14 season. What makes these men tick? They are familiar figures, who rarely offer anything more than a glimpse into their personal and professional lives. What shapes them? How and why do they do their job? Award-winning writer Michael Calvin provides the answers.

Insecurity is a unifying factor, but managers at different levels face different sets of problems. Depending on their status, they are dealing with multi-millionaires, or mortgage slaves. Living on the Volcano charts the progress of more than 20 managers, in different circumstances and in different phases of their career. Some, like Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez, are at the peak of their profession. Others, like Chris Hughton, Brian McDermott and Gary Waddock, have been sacked, and are seeking a way back into the game. They offer a unique insight into a trade which is prone to superficial judgement and savage swings in fortune. Management requires ruthlessness and empathy, idealism and cunning.

What really causes depression and anxiety - and how can we really solve them? Award-winning journalist Johann Hari suffered from depression since he was a child and started taking anti-depressants when he was a teenager. He was told that his problems were caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. As an adult, trained in the social sciences, he began to investigate whether this was true - and he learned that almost everything we have been told about depression and anxiety is wrong.
Across the world, Hari found social scientists who were uncovering evidence that depression and anxiety are not caused by a chemical imbalance in our brains. In fact, they are largely caused by key problems with the way we live today. Hari¬¥s journey took him from a mind-blowing series of experiments in Baltimore, to an Amish community in Indiana, to an uprising in Berlin. Once he had uncovered nine real causes of depression and anxiety, they led him to scientists who are discovering seven very different solutions - ones that work.
It is an epic journey that will change how we think about one of the biggest crises in our culture today. His TED talk - 'Everything You Think You Know About Addiction Is Wrong' - has been viewed more than 8 million times and revolutionized the global debate. This book will do the same."

Whether braving the homicidal motorists of Paris, being robbed by gypsies in Florence, attempting not to order tripe and eyeballs in a German restaurant or window-shopping in the sex shops of the Reeperbahn, Bryson takes in the sights, dissects the culture and illuminates each place and person with his hilariously caustic observations. He even goes to Liechtenstein."

It was the biggest leak in history. WikiLeaks infuriated the world's greatest superpower, embarrassed the British royal family and helped cause a revolution in North Africa. The man behind it was Julian Assange, one of the strangest figures ever to become a worldwide celebrity. Internet messiah or cyber-terrorist? Information freedom fighter or sex criminal?
In this newly updated edition, award-winning Guardian journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding follow the story as it takes on ever-weirder twists and turns. In London, Assange went to ground in the back bedroom of the Ecuadorian embassy. Meanwhile, in a courtroom near Washington, the fate of the US army whistleblower Bradley Manning hung in the balance. And in Hawaii, a young man named Edward Snowden, working as a contractor for the National Security Agency, was about to take WikiLeaks into even darker territory.

Wallander travels across the Baltic Sea, to Riga in Latvia, where he is plunged into a frozen, alien world of police surveillance, scarcely veiled threats, and lies.

In 1996, as a teenager, Afridi shot to fame after hammering the fastest ODI century at the time. One of the world's greatest all-rounders, today, he holds the distinction of having hit the most number of sixes in the history of ODI cricket scooping the most wickets in T20s and winning the most player-of-the match awards in the same format. From his humble beginnings in the mountains of Pakistan's unruly northwest to the mean streets of Karachi and the county parks of southern England, Afridi tells his life story just the way he bats - instinctively, candidly and with no holds barred. In a career as unpredictable as his leg-break googlies and 'boom-boom' power hitting, Afridi has been many things - the lost kid focused on pulling his parents out of poverty, the desperate captain trying not to snitch on his corrupt teammates, the gallant Pashtun centurion staring down a hostile Indian crowd, and the bad boy at the centre of a ball-tampering scandal.

4370,Privacy 3.0: Unlocking Our Data-Driven Future,Rahul Matthan,Law (Books),Politics,2.572871602,4.2,9,Hardcover,2018,Jul,"Our personal space is dear to us all. We live our lives in full public view on social media - posting photos of the food we just ate or even expressing intimate feelings for our loved ones - but there are still things we would rather not share with the world. Indeed, it is privacy that sets man apart from the animals who must stick together in the wild for their own safety. But mankind was not born private. Our primitive ancestors too lived in large groups, every member of which knew all there was to know about the others. Privacy evolved over time as man developed technologies to wall himself off, even as he remained part of the society at large. But just as some technologies enhanced privacy, others - such as the printing press or the portable camera - chipped away at it. Every time this happened, man opposed the technology at first but made his peace with it eventually to benefit from the obvious good it could do. We are at a similar crossroads today with data technologies. Aadhaar is one example of the many ways in which we have begun to use data in everything we do. While it has made it far easier to avail of services from the government and private enterprises than ever before, there are those who rightly worry about people's private data being put to ill use - and, worse, without consent. But this anxiety is no different from that which we felt during the teething troubles of every previous technology we adopted. What we really need is a new framework that unlocks the full potential of a data-driven future while still safeguarding what we hold most dear - our privacy. In this pioneering work, technology lawyer Rahul Matthan traces the changing notions of privacy from the earliest times to its evolution through landmark cases in the UK, US and India. In the process, he re-imagines the way we should be thinking about privacy today if we are to take full advantage of modern data technologies, cautioning against getting so obsessed with their potential harms that we design our laws to prevent us from benefiting from them at all."

Battle for Sanskrit seeks to alert traditional scholars of Sanskrit and sanskriti - Indian civilization - concerning an important school of thought that has its base in the US and that has started to dominate the discourse on the cultural, social and political aspects of India. The scholars of this field hold that many Sanskrit texts are socially oppressive and serve as political weapons in the hands of the ruling elite; that the sacred aspects need to be refuted; and that Sanskrit has long been dead. The traditional Indian experts would outright reject or at least question these positions. Is each view exclusive of the other, or can there be a bridge between them?"

791,"Doctor Socrates: Footballer, Philosopher, Legend",Andrew Downie,Americas,Sports,2.568201724,5,4,Paperback,2018,Jul,"A stunning new authorized biography of Socrates‚Äîthe iconic 1982 captain of Brazil‚Äôs greatest national soccer team to never win the World Cup.

Socrates was always special. With his 6‚Äô4‚Äù frame and incredible skill, the attacking midfielder stood out. He was a hugely talented athlete who graduated in medicine, yet drank and smoked to excess. Fans were enthralled by his inch-perfect passes, his coolness in front of the goal, and his back heel‚Äîthe trademark move that singled him out as the most unique footballer of his generation.

Off the pitch, he was just as original with a dedication to politics and social causes that no player has ever emulated. As the leader of Corinthians Democracy‚Äîa movement that gave everyone from the kitman to the president an equal say in the running of the club‚ÄîSocrates revolutionized football management and left a truly lasting impression at a time when Brazil was ruled by military dictatorship.

Passionate and principled, entertaining and erudite, Socrates was as contradictory as he was complex. He was a socialist who voted for a return of Brazil‚Äôs monarchy, a fiercely independent individual who was the ultimate team player, and a romantic who married four times and fathered six children.

Armed with Socrates‚Äôs unpublished memoir and hours of newly discovered interviews, Andrew Downie has created the most comprehensive and compelling account of this iconic figure. Based on conversations with family members, close friends, and former teammates, Doctor Socrates is the brilliant biography of a man who always stood up for what he believed in‚Äîwhatever the cost."

Dick's The Man in the High Castle includes an introduction by Eric Brown in Penguin Modern Classics.
Philip K. Dick's acclaimed cult novel gives us a horrifying glimpse of an alternative world - one where the Allies have lost the Second World War. In this nightmare dystopia the Nazis have taken over New York, the Japanese control California and the African continent is virtually wiped out. In a neutral buffer zone in America that divides the world's new rival superpowers, lives the author of an underground bestseller. His book offers a new vision of reality - an alternative theory of world history in which the Axis powers were defeated - giving hope to the disenchanted. Does 'reality' lie with him, or is his world just one among many others?
Philip Kindred Dick (1928-82) was born in Chicago in 1928. His career as a science fiction writer comprised an early burst of short stories followed by a stream of novels, typically character studies incorporating androids, drugs, and hallucinations. His best works are generally agreed to be The Man in the High Castle and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the inspiration for the movie Blade Runner.
If you enjoyed The Man in the High Castle, you might like Yevgeny Zamyatin's We, also available in Penguin Classics.

For if the artists of classical Greece could find the perfect fusion of content and form, modernity faced complicating - and ultimately disabling - questions. Christianity, with its code of unworldliness, had compromised the immediacy of man's relationship with reality, and ironic detachment had alienated him from his deepest feelings. Hegel's Introductory Lectures on Aesthetics were delivered in Berlin in the 1820s and stand today as a passionately argued work that challenged the ability of art to respond to the modern world."

'Islam began as a stranger,' said the Prophet Mohammed, 'and one day, it will again return to being a stranger.'
The gulf between Islam and the West is widening. A faith rich with strong values and traditions, observed by nearly two billion people across the world, is seen by the West as something to be feared rather than understood. Sensational headlines and hard-line policies spark enmity, while ignoring the feelings, narratives and perceptions that preoccupy Muslims today.
Wise and authoritative, The House of Islam seeks to provide entry to the minds and hearts of Muslims the world over. It introduces us to the fairness, kindness and mercy of Mohammed; the aims of sharia law, through commentary on scripture, to provide an ethical basis to life; the beauty of Islamic art and the permeation of the divine in public spaces; and the tension between mysticism and literalism that still threatens the House of Islam.
The decline of the Muslim world and the current crises of leadership mean that a glorious past, full of intellectual nobility and purpose, is now exploited by extremists and channelled into acts of terror. How can Muslims confront the issues that are destroying Islam from within, and what can the West do to help work towards that end?
Ed Husain expertly and compassionately guides us through the nuances of Islam and its people, contending that the Muslim world need not be a stranger to the West, nor its enemy, but a peaceable ally."

Cary With an introduction by Claire Honess. Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) is one of the most important and innovative figures of the European Middle Ages. Writing his Comedy (the epithet Divine was added by later admirers) in exile from his native Florence, he aimed to address a world gone astray both morally and politically. At the same time, he sought to push back the restrictive rules which traditionally governed writing in the Italian vernacular, to produce a radically new and all-encompassing work. The Comedy tells of the journey of a character who is at one and the same time both Dante himself and Everyman through the three realms of the Christian afterlife: Hell, Purgatory and Heaven. He presents a vision of the afterlife which is strikingly original in its conception, with a complex architecture and a coherent structure. On this journey Dante's protagonist - and his reader - meet characters who are variously noble, grotesque, beguiling, fearful, ridiculous, admirable, horrific and tender, and through them he is shown the consequences of sin, repentance and virtue, as he learns to avoid Hell and, through cleansing in Purgatory, to taste the joys of Heaven."

WINNER OF THE CMI MANAGEMENT FUTURES BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD

'A manual for thinking clearly in an uncertain world. Read it.' Daniel Kahneman


What if we could improve our ability to predict the future?

Everything we do involves forecasts about how the future will unfold. Whether buying a new house or changing job, designing a new product or getting married, our decisions are governed by implicit predictions of how things are likely to turn out. The problem is, we're not very good at it.

In a landmark, twenty-year study, Wharton professor Philip Tetlock showed that the average expert was only slightly better at predicting the future than a layperson using random guesswork. Tetlock's latest project ‚Äì an unprecedented, government-funded forecasting tournament involving over a million individual predictions ‚Äì has since shown that there are, however, some people with real, demonstrable foresight. These are ordinary people, from former ballroom dancers to retired computer programmers, who have an extraordinary ability to predict the future with a degree of accuracy 60% greater than average. They are superforecasters.

In Superforecasting, Tetlock and his co-author Dan Gardner offer a fascinating insight into what we can learn from this elite group. They show the methods used by these superforecasters which enable them to outperform even professional intelligence analysts with access to classified data. And they offer practical advice on how we can all use these methods for our own benefit ‚Äì whether in business, in international affairs, or in everyday life.


'The techniques and habits of mind set out in this book are a gift to anyone who has to think about what the future might bring. In other words, to everyone.' Economist

'A terrific piece of work that deserves to be widely read . . . Highly recommended.' Independent

'The best thing I have read on predictions . . . Superforecasting is an indispensable guide to this indispensable activity.' The Times"

A trick that does not depend upon legerdemain or special abilities on the part of the magician, but a trick that works automatically because of the mathematics inherent in the card deck itself. Long practice and supernormal dexterity are not needed to perform these tricks, yet they are often among the most entertaining and most spectacular of all card tricks.
Some of these sure-fire tricks are simple, a good place to begin. Others were specially adapted from professional routines and are here presented for the first time for amateurs. Almost all of these tricks can be worked informally, with a borrowed deck of cards. Some also adapt to stage presentation.
Individual tricks in this book have sold for more than the price of the entire book. Amateurs can use them to get a start in magic and to feel, at once, the rewards of giving a professional performance. Advanced and professional magicians will find tricks to add to their acts or informal routines. Author Karl Fulves is one of the best-known writers and editors in the field of magic."

‚ÄòThe father of virtual reality‚Äô (Sunday Times) explains why virtual reality presents the ultimate test for humanity.

‚ÄòEssential reading, not just for VR-watchers but for anyone interested in how society came to be how it is, and what it might yet become‚Äô Economist

Welcome to a mind-expanding, life-enhancing, world-changing adventure.

Virtual reality has long been one of the dominant clich√©s of science fiction. Now virtual reality is a reality: from the startling beauty of lifelike video games to the place where war veterans overcome PTSD, surgeries are trialled, and aircraft and cities are designed. VR is, in fact now, the most effective device ever invented for researching what a human being actually is ‚Äì and how we think and feel.

More than thirty years ago, legendary computer scientist, visionary and artist Jaron Lanier pioneered its invention. Here he blends scientific investigation, philosophical thought experiment and his memoir of a life lived at the centre of digital innovation to explain what VR really is: the science of comprehensive illusion; the extension of the intimate magic of earliest childhood into adulthood; a hint of what life would be like without any limits.

We are standing on the threshold of an entirely new realm of human creativity, expression, communication and experience, and as we use VR to test our relationship with reality, it may test us in return.

A compelling account of the top-class sporting life, The Cricket War also gives a unique insight into the motives and methods of the man who became Australia's richest, and remained so, until the day he died. It was the end of cricket as we knew it - and the beginning of cricket as we know it.

He is undoubtedly one of the most iconic and controversial leaders in India's recent history. In spite of his significant political and ideological differences with Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr Mookerjee was inducted to the first cabinet of independent India. However, following the Delhi Pact between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan, Dr Mookerjee resigned from the cabinet. His role during the Great Bengal Famine of 1943 and the Great Calcutta Killings and Noakhali Carnage of 1946 was historic. His premature death in custody--in Kashmir--remains one of the unsolved mysteries of India's political history.

As a dress designer, few could match. An ingenious architect, she innovated the use of marble in her parents' mausoleum on the banks of the Yamuna, which inspired her stepson's Taj Mahal. And she was both celebrated and reviled for her political acumen and diplomatic skill, which rivaled those of her female counterparts in Europe and beyond.
In 1611, thirty-four-year-old Nur Jahan, daughter of a Persian noble and widow of a subversive official, became the twentieth and most cherished wife of Emperor Jahangir. While other wives were secluded behind walls, Nur ruled the vast Mughal Empire alongside her husband, and governed in his stead when his health failed and his attention wandered from matters of state. An astute politician and a devoted partner, Nur led troops into battle to free Jahangir when he was imprisioned by one of his officers. She signed and issued imperial orders, and coins of the realm bore her name.
Acclaimed historian Ruby Lal uncovers the rich life and world of Nur Jahan, rescuing this dazzling figure from patriarchal and orientalist cliches of romance and intrigue, while giving a new insight into the lives of the women and the girls during the Mughal Empire, even where scholars claim there are no sources. Nur's confident assertion of authority and talent is revelatory. In Empress, she finally receives her due in a deeply researched and evocative biography that awakens us to a fascinating history."

451,Aspects of the Novel (Penguin Classics),E.M. Forster,Writing Guides (Books),"Language, Linguistics & Writing",2.537819095,3.7,5,Paperback,2005,Sep,"E.M. Forster's Aspects of the Novel is an innovative and effusive treatise on a literary form that, at the time of publication, had only recently begun to enjoy serious academic consideration. This Penguin Classics edition is edited with an introduction by Oliver Stallybrass, and features a new preface by Frank Kermode. First given as a series of lectures at Cambridge University, Aspects of the Novel is Forster's analysis of this great literary form. Here he rejects the 'pseudoscholarship' of historical criticism - 'that great demon of chronology' - that considers writers in terms of the period in which they wrote and instead asks us to imagine the great novelists working together in a single room. He discusses aspects of people, plot, fantasy and rhythm, making illuminating comparisons between novelists such as Proust and James, Dickens and Thackeray, Eliot and Dostoyevsky - the features shared by their books and the ways in which they differ. Written in a wonderfully engaging and conversational manner, this penetrating work of criticism is full of Forster's habitual irreverence, wit and wisdom. In his new introduction, Frank Kermode discusses the ways in which Forster's perspective as a novelist inspired his lectures. This edition also includes the original introduction by Oliver Stallybrass, a chronology, further reading and appendices. E. M. Forster (1879-1970) was a noted English author and critic and a member of the Bloomsbury group. His first novel, Where Angels Fear To Tread appeared in 1905. The Longest Journey appeared in 1907, followed by A Room With A View (1908), based partly on the material from extended holidays in Italy with his mother. Howards End (1910) was a story that centered on an English country house and dealt with the clash between two families, one interested in art and literature, the other only in business. Maurice was revised several times during his life, and finally published posthumously in 1971. If you enjoyed Aspects of the Novel, you might like Forster's A Room with a View, also available in Penguin Classics."
3388,The Games: A Global History of the Olympics,David Goldblatt,History (Books),Sports,2.537819095,4,1,Paperback,2018,Jan,"The Olympic Games have become the single greatest festival of a universal and cosmopolitan humanity. Seventeen days of sporting competition watched and followed on every continent and in every country on the planet. Simply, the greatest show on earth. Yet when the modern games were inaugurated in Athens in 1896, the founders thought them a ""display of manly virtue"", an athletic celebration of the kind of amateur gentleman that would rule the world. How was such a ritual invented? Why did it prosper and how has it been so utterly transformed? In The Games, David Goldblatt - winner of the 2015 William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award - takes on a breathtakingly ambitious search for the answers and brilliantly unravels the complex strands of this history. Beginning with the Olympics as a sporting side show at the great Worlds Fairs of the Belle Epoque and its transformation into a global media spectacular, care of Hollywood and the Nazi party, The Games shows how sport and the Olympics had been a battlefield during the Cold War, a defining moment for social and economic change in host cities and countries, and a theatre of resistance for women and athletes of colour once excluded from the show. Illuminated with dazzling vignettes from over a century of Olympic competition - this stunningly researched history captures the excitement of sporting brilliance and the kaleidoscopic experience of the Games. It shows us how this sporting spectacle has come to reflect the world we hope to inhabit and the one we actually live in."

So great was his stature as an Urdu poet that he never had to mould his poetry to suit the demands of film songwriting; instead, producers and composers adapted their requirements to his poetry. His songs in films like Pyaasa, Naya Daur and Phir Subah Hogi have attained the status of classics. This exhaustive biography traces the poet's rich life, from his troubled childhood and his equally troubled love relationships, to his rise as one of the pre-eminent personalities of the Progressive Writers Movement and his journey as lyricist through the golden era of Hindi film music, the 1950s and 1960s."

‚ÄòThe best fantasy debut of 2018‚Äô WIRED
A brilliantly imaginative epic fantasy debut, inspired by the bloody history of China‚Äôs twentieth century and filled with treachery and magic.
When Rin aced the Keju ‚Äì the test to find the most talented students in the Empire ‚Äì it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn‚Äôt believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin‚Äôs guardians, who had hoped to get rich by marrying her off; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free from a life of servitude. That she got into Sinegard ‚Äì the most elite military school in Nikan ‚Äì was even more surprising.
But surprises aren‚Äôt always good.
Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Fighting the prejudice of rival classmates, Rin discovers that she possesses a lethal, unearthly power ‚Äì an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of psychoactive substances and a seemingly insane teacher, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive ‚Äì and that mastering these powers could mean more than just surviving school.
For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea.

3435,The Chinar Leaves: A Political Memoir,M.L. Fotedar,Biographies & Autobiographies (Books),Politics,2.531478917,3,16,Hardcover,2015,Nov,"One day, soon after M.L. Fotedar had joined Indira Gandhi as political secretary in July 1980, she told him to sit at 1 Akbar Road. This would enable him to meet the people who came to her with various requests. She suggested a small room to serve as his workspace. But it was one she was emotionally attached to - it was used by her son Sanjay, who had recently died in an air crash. For the rest of Indira Gandhi's final term in office, this room would be the nerve centre of Fotedar's work. Ordinary people and senior party leaders would come there for him to filter their requests and complaints. From assessing future leaders - be it V.P. Singh, Pranab Mukherjee or Ahmed Patel - with remarkable foresight, to straightening up those who were being difficult, he did it all. The Chinar Leaves paints a portrait of a six-decade-long political career that began in Kashmir and gives insights into the murky world of national politics. Here are the stories of many careers that were made and unmade in the Congress. Among these are the saga of Narasimha Rao's no-holds-barred effort to stay in power, Amitabh Bachchan's falling out of favour with the Gandhi family, the machinations of succession after Indira Gandhi's death, Giani Zail Singh's tiff with Rajiv, and many more. Fotedar, for long the voice of political wisdom in the party, also passes his verdict on the current crop of Congress leadership and searches Indira Gandhi's will, to which he was a signatory, for the true successor to her legacy. As a record of Indian politics at a time of momentous events, this is a frank and sometimes shocking look at recent history from the man who exercised immense influence from behind the scenes and whose impact continues to this day."

Proposing a number of concrete strategies for how liberal democrats should best deal with populists, M√ºller shows how to counter their claims to speak exclusively for ""the silent majority""."

WINNER OF THE CMI MANAGEMENT FUTURES BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD

'A manual for thinking clearly in an uncertain world. Read it.' Daniel Kahneman


What if we could improve our ability to predict the future?

Everything we do involves forecasts about how the future will unfold. Whether buying a new house or changing job, designing a new product or getting married, our decisions are governed by implicit predictions of how things are likely to turn out. The problem is, we're not very good at it.

In a landmark, twenty-year study, Wharton professor Philip Tetlock showed that the average expert was only slightly better at predicting the future than a layperson using random guesswork. Tetlock's latest project ‚Äì an unprecedented, government-funded forecasting tournament involving over a million individual predictions ‚Äì has since shown that there are, however, some people with real, demonstrable foresight. These are ordinary people, from former ballroom dancers to retired computer programmers, who have an extraordinary ability to predict the future with a degree of accuracy 60% greater than average. They are superforecasters.

In Superforecasting, Tetlock and his co-author Dan Gardner offer a fascinating insight into what we can learn from this elite group. They show the methods used by these superforecasters which enable them to outperform even professional intelligence analysts with access to classified data. And they offer practical advice on how we can all use these methods for our own benefit ‚Äì whether in business, in international affairs, or in everyday life.


'The techniques and habits of mind set out in this book are a gift to anyone who has to think about what the future might bring. In other words, to everyone.' Economist

'A terrific piece of work that deserves to be widely read . . . Highly recommended.' Independent

'The best thing I have read on predictions . . . Superforecasting is an indispensable guide to this indispensable activity.' The Times"
5355,Autobiography of an Unknown Indian,Nirad C. Chaudhuri,Asian History,"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.5289167,3.8,20,Paperback,1964,Nov,"About the Book
Written by a self-confessed Anglophile, Autobiography of An Unknown Indian is a witty and endearing account of Nirad C. Chaudhuri's life. The book delves into the mind of the author as he takes his readers down memory lane to a pre-independence India. Written in a sarcastic manner that takes potshots at both Indian as well as British cultures, this book is one of the early works of Indian literature written in English.
The book offers an authentic peek into the way India functioned during the last days of British rule. It draws various incidents from the author's life and lets us understand his views on life gained from his different experiences. Born into an educated Bengali household, the author led a life where the majority of his influences were from the western part of the world.
The book starts off with a dedication to the British rule meant in a witty and sarcastic way. However, since the book was published post independence, when nationalist sentiments were at an all-time high, his dedication was misinterpreted and led to a personal ordeal. While his book was praised unanimously in the West, he was awarded with criticism back in India.
Autobiography of An Unknown Indian is the memoir of an ordinary Indian who was well-educated in the British way of life. The first edition of this book was published by Jaico Publishing House in 1964. It is available in paperback format.
Key Features
Self-written account of a Bengali-English writer who was also a cultural commentator.
Gives an authentic overview into the quality of a Bengali-Indian's life during the pre-independence era.
Written by an educated person who was adept in the British ways of living."

As a player and as a captain he has reached the pinnacle of Australian cricket. His side has been compared to Bradman's Invincibles, and the media coverage following his retirement from Test cricket was reignited by his controversial naming as Australian of the Year for 2004. Many though, including Jack Egan, have long wondered about the private man behind the public face of Australia's most successful Test captain. For all the media coverage, including his own tour diaries, Waugh guards his privacy fiercely. This unauthorised biography by a respected cricketing writer and documentary-maker is not only a tribute to a player who has given the world some of the most magic moments in recent cricket, but also an honest exploration of the man himself. Who is Steve Waugh? Jack Egan traces Waugh's career from his shaky debut on the international scene to his mastery of field placing and attacking Test cricket, revisiting a few of his key innings along the way. This is a comprehensive and objective picture of one of Australia's most successful sportsmen, his successes and failures, his effect for good, and bad, on the game on which the Australian team currently has such a stranglehold."

'AB has become the most valuable cricketer on the planet' Adam Gilchrist
AB de Villiers is one of the finest batsmen ever to play cricket, and yet his achievement extends beyond his outrageous armoury of drives, pulls, paddles, scoops and flicks.
Whether he is delighting home crowds at the Wanderers or Newlands or setting new records in Bengaluru or Sydney, he plays the game in a whole-hearted manner that projects a positive image of his country around the world, and also makes millions of South Africans feel good about themselves.
This is AB's story, in his own words. The story of the youngest of three talented, sports-mad brothers growing up in Warmbaths, of a boy who excelled at tennis, rugby and cricket, of a youngster who made his international debut at the age of twenty and was then selected in every single test played by South Africa for the next eleven seasons, of a batsman who has started to redefine the art, being ranked among the world's very best in test, ODI and T20.
Through all the pyrotechnics and consistency, AB de Villiers has remained a true sportsman - quick to deflect praise, swift to praise opponents, eager to work hard, to embrace the team's next challenge and to relish what he still regards as the huge privilege of representing his country.
This is the story of a modern sporting phenomenon."

Its dazzling mixture of fantasy and satire is narrated by a personification of Folly, dressed as a jester, who celebrates youth, pleasure, drunkenness and sexual desire, and goes on to lambast human pretensions, foibles and frailties, to mock theologians and monks and to praise the 'folly' of simple Christian piety. Erasmus's wit, wordplay and wisdom made the book an instant success, but it also attracted what may have been sales-boosting criticism.

Viewed by many as one of the most influential figures in Premier League history, and scorer of the goal that Arsenal fans voted the best in the club's history, Dennis Bergkamp is a true giant of the game.

As a youngster, Bergkamp learned from the Dutch master Johan Cruyff. By the time the pupil was ready to graduate from Ajax and move abroad, he was ready to spread the word, but in Italy he found few willing listeners. It was only when he moved to Arsenal and linked up with Arsene Wenger that he met someone else who shared his vision for football's possibilities. Bergkamp became central to everything the club did: now he had become the teacher, their creative genius, and the one who inspired some of the wayward old guard to new heights, helping them to seven major trophies.

Few footballers' books make you think anew, but in Stillness and Speed Bergkamp presents a new vision for the game and how it might be played. He was a player like no other; his story is told like no other. It is a book that will inspire football fans everywhere, whatever their allegiance."

They say, 'the more you write personal, the more it becomes universal'. This is evident in this collection of letters that Jawaharlal Nehru sent to his daughter Indira when she was 10 years old. This book, 'Letters from a Father to His Daughter' is a collection of 30 letters sent in the year 1928 which has become a phenomenal piece of literature over the years because it puts a lot of light on the bond between a father and his daughter and the many things that Pandit Nehru tried to explain to her while being away on business. Originally written in English, these letters are still relevant over a span of ninety years and that is exactly where their beauty lies.
Diverse Letters
The collection of these letters spans over a large range and has many topics covered in it. Nehru began writing to his 10-year-old daughter when she was in Mussourie and he was in Allahabad. In order to tell his daughter about all the wonderful things in the world and his many thoughts on people and the society, he wrote her diverse letters that initially spoke of how the earth was formed, how animal and human life came into existence and how societies entered the fray. Nehru further also writes about races, faith and beliefs that existed in those times. The letters cover a major portion of human history and the history of India as well.
Hardcover Book
This is one of the finest books published by Penguin India. The best thing about this book is that since it has stood the test of time and seems relevant ninety years later, it sure is something that can be handed down from one generation to another. For these reasons, Penguin has compiled the book in a rather solid manner with a hardcover.

Is it a fact? Or, is this a myth? After all, do we know enough?
The shocking blasts of Malegaon and Samjhauta were projected as 'saffron terrorism'. A new theory, terrorist attacks were tainted as such till, a few years later, Kasab's confession offered solid proof of Pakistan's role in the 26/11 attacks. Though the police had concluded a Pakistani hand for the earlier blasts, it was saffron terrorism which prevented the perpetrators of these attacks from being brought to justice.
As a theory, saffron terrorism is not just hurting Hindus sentiments but is also an obstacle to fight real terrorism sponsored by Pakistan and Islamic states. The term was coined by the erstwhile UPA government to garner minority votes and manipulate the vote bank. After all, why were the Malegaon-accused SIMI activists let off? Why did certain politicians declare not to oppose their bail? What was truly behind Aseemanand's confession? The reliability of these confessions was questionable given the police brutality that the National Investigative Agency exposed.
Journalist Praveen Tiwari explores saffron terrorism and reveals through exclusive interviews of senior National Investigative Agency officials, undercover agents and politicians how vote bank politics can compromise ethics and national security. Should the real masterminds behind the blasts be allowed to go scot-free? Should the manipulators of the Samjhauta Express bombings not be held accountable? Should we not investigate those who had exonerated Pakistan of its guilt? An extensive research on communal politics, the book offers indisputable evidence of the 'saffron terrorism' theory as the Great Indian Conspiracy."

China: 1200 A.D.
The Song Empire has been invaded by its warlike Jurchen neighbours from the north. Half its territory and its historic capital lie in enemy hands; the peasants toil under the burden of the annual tribute demanded by the victors. Meanwhile, on the Mongolian steppe, a disparate nation of great warriors is about to be united by a warlord whose name will endure for eternity: Genghis Khan.
Guo Jing, son of a murdered Song patriot, grew up with Genghis Khan's army. He is humble, loyal, perhaps not altogether wise, and is fated from birth to one day confront an opponent who is the opposite of him in every way: privileged, cunning and flawlessly trained in the martial arts.
Guided by his faithful shifus, The Seven Heroes of the South, Guo Jing must return to China - to the Garden of the Drunken Immortals in Jiaxing - to fulfil his destiny. But in a divided land riven by war and betrayal, his courage and his loyalties will be tested at every turn.

‚ÄòCatch-22‚Äô is a revolutionary book by Joseph Heller which was first published in 1961. This book is a one of its kind. Heller uses a non-chronological third person omniscient narration to bind the threads together. Ideas flow into each other through random connections within the story. Events have been repeated through different point of views. The story is situated in the time of World War 2. This story is about the life of Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces bombardier in 256th squadron who has been assigned to bomb enemy posts at eastern France and Italy.
The phrase ‚ÄòCatch-22‚Äô was later added in English language referring to a type of impossible logic puzzle sometimes called a double bind. According to this story unstable men do not have to fly aircrafts, but the fact that they can rationally decide for themselves and ask for waiver, proves that they are stable enough. Yossarian is the lead character of this story. A man who is afraid of his own commanding officers because he thinks that they want to kill him, by making him work more while all he wants is to escape from the situation. He has seen his friends dying and a lot more destruction. He wants to quit, but he can't. The story is quite unique in its narration. Many times in this story, jokes are completed through different point of view. This is a satirical novel. If you are looking for a piece of writing that is complex and humorous, pick this one.

A truly brilliant thriller by Tom Clancy, The Bear and the Dragon is a Jack Ryan novel.
Newly elected in his own right, Jack Ryan has found that being President has gotten no easier: domestic pitfalls await him at every turn; the Asian economy is going down the tubes; and now, in Moscow, someone may have tried to take out the chairman of the SVR - the former KGB - with a rocket-propelled grenade. Things are unstable enough in Russia without high-level assassination, but even more disturbing may be the identities of the potential assassins. Were they political enemies, the Russian Mafia, disaffected former KGB? Or, Ryan wonders, is something far more dangerous at work here?
Ryan is right to wonder. For even while Russian investigators pursue the case, and some of his most trusted eyes and ears, including antiterrorism specialist John Clark, head to Moscow, forces in China are moving forward with a plan of truly audacious proportions. Tired of what they view as the presumption of the West, eager to fulfill their destiny, they are taking matters into their own hands. If they succeed, the world as we know it will never look the same. If they fail. . . the consequences may be unspeakable.
The Bear and the Dragon is Tom Clancy at his best - and there is none better. This is the third Jack Ryan thriller, following Without Remorse and Rainbow Six.

The very mention of Madhubala (born on St. Valentine‚Äôs Day, 14 February 1933) conjures up a vivid image of a love goddess possessing bewitching beauty, dazzling radiance, subtle sensuality, and, above all, a tantalizing screen presence. Her histrionic performances held (and continue to hold) audiences/viewers entranced.
Her talent was phenomenal and she could literally glide through a movie, whatever be the role. She could convey an impressive array of emotions with her eloquent eyes and nuanced expressions without resorting to melodramatic facial contortions. Tragedy, romance, comedy, drama and what have you ‚Äì she could take everything in her stride, exquisitely and flawlessly, as convincingly proved by superhits such as Mahal, Tarana, Mr. and Mrs. ‚Äô55, Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi and the magnum opus, Mughal-e-Azam.
The author, on the basis of extensive research and interviews with many of those who interacted with Madhubala (who mostly remained elusive), presents a spectacular panorama not only of the ‚Äòreel-life‚Äô actress but also of the ‚Äòreal-life‚Äô human being, who was extremely caring and compassionate, but lived in the shadow of her dominating father. This volume recounts her life story right from her first film (Basant, 1942), as a child star, up to the magnificent Mughal-e-Azam (1960) and beyond. Enthralling scenes from some of her film masterpieces are described in graphic detail. The drama involved in her love affair with Dilip Kumar, which culminated in intense acrimony, has been poignantly and sensitively portrayed.
The last few years of her life were spent in virtual solitude, despite her being married to Kishore Kumar and death (on 23 February 1969), in a way, came as a release for her.
But the legend of Madhubala lives on . . ."

His family didn‚Äôt always have it good. His father, a criminal lawyer, succumbed to a celebral stroke when Virat was very young, depriving him of someone he calls his ‚Äòbiggest support‚Äô both on and off the field. The son paid his tribute to Prem Kohli in a way the older man himself would have applauded: Virat Kohli returned to the field to continue an innings a few hours after he lost him. ‚ÄòHe was the one who drove me to practice every day, ‚Äô the captain of the Indian cricket team recalls with his characteristic humility and grace.
Widely read sports journalist Vijay Lokapally goes on to record happier times on the journey of Virat‚Äôs rapid rise to international stardom, an account punctuated by little-known stories by his fellow players, coaches and intimates.
At 28, he has already been the recipient of countless accolades ‚Äî not the least of them being the Arjuna Award and the title of BCCI‚Äôs ‚ÄòInternational Cricketer of the Year‚Äô for the 2011-12 and 2014-15 seasons. He was the ICC‚Äôs ‚ÄòODI Player of the Year‚Äô as early as in 2012.

But for the Run Machine, it‚Äôs not about the money or fame or the roar of the crowds or that women of all ages vie for the wide-eyed attention of his extraordinary gaze. Few incidences have been reported of his open hearted altruism, his numerous charities for under-privileged children and his sheer pluck when the odds are against him.
But what has not escaped the public eye is how this wizard of the willow and wicket wears his heavy mantle with such insouciant ease."

Born five years and seven thousand miles apart, they became embodiments of the nations they led. Both became living icons, idolized and admired around the world. Today, they remain enduring models of leadership in a democratic society.

Yet the truth was Churchill and Gandhi were bitter enemies throughout their lives. This book reveals, for the first time, how that rivalry shaped the twentieth century and beyond. For more than forty years, from 1906 to 1948, Gandhi and Churchill were locked in a tense struggle for the hearts and minds of the British public, and of world opinion. Although they met only once, their titanic contest of wills would decide the fate of nations, continents, peoples, and ultimately an Empire.

Here is a sweeping epic with a fascinating supporting cast, and a brilliant narrative parable of two men whose great successes were always haunted by personal failure - and whose final moments of triumph were overshadowed by the loss of what they held most dear."

Lala,Asian History,"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.481442629,4.8,10,Paperback,2006,May,"Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata was born in 1839, and in his lifetime India remained firmly under British rule. Yet the projects he envisioned laid the foundation for the nation‚Äôs development once it became independent. More extraordinary still, these institutions continue to set the pace for others in their respective areas. For, among his many achievements are the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, which has groomed some of the country‚Äôs best scientists, the Tata Steel plant in Jamshedpur, which marked the country‚Äôs transition from trading to manufacturing, his pioneering hydro-electric project, and the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai, one of the finest in the world. In these as in other projects he undertook, Jamsetji revealed the unerring instinct of a man who knew what it would take to restore the pride of a subjugated nation and help it prepare for a place among the leading nations of the world once it came into its own. The scale of the projects required abilities of a high order. In some cases it was sheer perseverance that paid off‚Äîas with finding a suitable site for the steel project. In others, such as the Indian Institute of Science, it was his exceptional persuasive skills and patience that finally got him the approval of a reluctant viceroy, Lord Curzon. In For the Love of India, R.M. Lala has drawn upon fresh material from the India Office Library in London and other archives, as also Jamsetji‚Äôs letters, to portray the man and his age. It is an absorbing account that makes clear how remarkable Jamsetji‚Äôs achievement truly was, and why, even now, one hundred years after his death, he seems like a man well ahead of the times."

The English translation, first published in 2000 and recognized as a new alphabet of experience, pushed Dalit writing into high relief.

4530,Kanshiram: Leader Of The Dalits,Badri Narayan,Public Policy,Politics,2.477121255,4.3,16,Paperback,2018,Nov,"Venerated as a Dalit icon, Kanshiram (1934-2006) is regarded as being next only to Ambedkar today. This book illuminates his journey, from the early years in rural Punjab and with Ambedkarites in Pune, to his launching BAMCEF, and eventually the Bahujan Samaj Party in 1984.
Drawing on myriad oral and written sources, Badri Narayan shows how Kanshiram rouses Dalits' self-respect with his homespun idiom, cycle rallies and, uniquely, the use of local folk myths. In contrast to Ambedkar, who sought to annihilate caste, Kanshiram forged Dalit identity as a source of political empowerment and struck opportunistic alliances with higher-caste parties-a vision that his prot√©g√©e, Mayawati, continues topursue. Narayan also describes Kanshiram's extraordinary relationship with Mayawati, right until his death.
Authoritative and insightful, this is a rare portrait of the man who changed the face of dalit society and, indeed, of Indian politics."

It is a book that is designed for those who have an interest in politics, the social sciences and for those who are keen to know our country's history.
The book traces the growth of Indian political thought, right from its roots to the structure it has acquired in the present day. Political philosophy had its origin in ancient times, where a clear demarcation was made between nation and the state and religion and the state. Gradually, states began to evolve based on political treaties and social institutions. These states were divided into governance, administration, defense and law and order on the basis of the duties they performed for the citizens. The offices of institutions were presided over by the King, the Prime Minister, the commander in chief of army and the chief priest of the King.
Foundations of Indian Political Thought: An Interpretation - From Manu to the Present Day covers the complexities of Indian political philosophy, discussing about ancient societies and the laws that governed them, to how they have shaped the political structure of the present day scenario. It elaborates the theories of all the major political thinkers such as Manu and Kausalya, to the political theorists of today.

3061,Blessed - The Autobiography,George Best,Biographies & Autobiographies (Books),Sports,2.451786436,4.8,5,Paperback,2002,Aug,"George Best needs little introduction. A legend in his own lifetime, he is undoubtedly the greatest footballer the UK has ever produced. Blessed with an extraordinary gift he brought a beauty and grace to the game never before seen. But Best was unable to cope with the success and fame his football genius brought. His fabled story is littered with tales of women and sex and, of course, alcohol.

Much has been written about Best, but very little substantiated by the man himself. That is until George Best opened his heart and engaged us in one of the most exhilarating life stories for years, Blessed. In his own words George recounts the halcyon days at Manchester United, the big games and European Cup win of '68. And then there's the heartbreaking truth about the death of his mother and his struggles with alcohol that forced him to face up to a life without drink.

Blessed reveals the man behind the up-for-a-laugh, boozy, womanizing stereotype that had dogged George Best for so long. Open and honest about his mistakes, George is also incredibly candid about his triumphs, his regrets, and, only three years before his death, what he had hoped for the future.

One grandfather fought alongside Lawrence of Arabia. The other is acclaimed as the first true Arab nationalist. Her uncle was Prime Minister for nearly forty years, her mother an important politician. When Saddam Hussein and his Ba'ath party seized power, and instituted his reign of terror, Mayada found herself alone in Baghdad, a divorced parent of two children, earning a meagre living printing brochures. Until one morning in August 1999 she was summarily arrested and dragged to the notorious Baladiyat Prison, falsely accused of printing anti-government propaganda.

There she was thrown into a cell with 17 'shadow women'. Like latter-day Sherezades, these women passed their days, while waiting for the next interrogation and torture session, telling each other their stories. They were eager to hear Mayada's stories of her privileged former life, of the history of her proud family, of kings and queens, of meetings with Saddam himself.

Not only the story of a woman intimately connected to Iraq's cultured, ancient history, this book is a powerful witness to the terror and horror wrought by Saddam on the lives and souls of its ordinary citizens."

Michael Frayn The Strangest Man is the Costa Biography Award-winning account of Paul Dirac, the famous physicist sometimes called the British Einstein. He was one of the leading pioneers of the greatest revolution in twentieth-century science: quantum mechanics. The youngest theoretician ever to win the Nobel Prize for Physics, he was also pathologically reticent, strangely literal-minded and legendarily unable to communicate or empathize. Through his greatest period of productivity, his postcards home contained only remarks about the weather. Based on a previously undiscovered archive of family papers, Graham Farmelo celebrates Dirac's massive scientific achievement while drawing a compassionate portrait of his life and work. Farmelo shows a man who, while hopelessly socially inept, could manage to love and sustain close friendship. The Strangest Man is an extraordinary and moving human story, as well as a study of one of the most exciting times in scientific history. 'A wonderful book . . . Moving, sometimes comic, sometimes infinitely sad, and goes to the roots of what we mean by truth in science.' Lord Waldegrave, Daily Telegraph"

The allegation that sections of and individual Indian Muslims indulged in terrorism surfaced for the first time with the ascent of the Hindutva forces in mid-1990s and became state policy with the BJP s coming to power at the Centre. With even secular media joining the role as stenographers of security agencies, this became an accepted fact so much so that common Indians and even many Muslims started believing in this false propaganda. This book, by a former senior police officer, with a distinguished career that included unearthing the Telgi scam, peeps behind the propaganda screen, using material mostly in the public domain as well as his long police experience. It comes out with some startling facts and analysis, the first of its kind, to expose the real actors behind the so-called Islamic terrorism in India whose greatest feat was to murder the Maharashtra ATS chief Hemant Karkare who dared to expose these forces and paid with his life for his courage and commitment to truth. While unearthing the conspiracy behind the murder of Karkare, this book takes a hard look at some of the major incidents attributed to Islamic terrorism in India and finds them baseless."

As he would later write in the first of a series of deeply moving Vanity Fair pieces, he was being deported 'from the country of the well across the stark frontier that marks off the land of malady.' Over the next year he underwent the brutal gamut of modern cancer treatment, enduring catastrophic levels of suffering and eventually losing the ability to speak. Mortality is the most meditative collection of writing Hitchens has ever produced; at once an unsparingly honest account of the ravages of his disease, an examination of cancer etiquette, and the coda to a lifetime of fierce debate and peerless prose. In this eloquent confrontation with mortality, Hitchens returns a human face to a disease that has become a contemporary cipher of suffering."

There was immediate uproar. The incident was, in many ways, the culmination of a life of youthful rebellion and brash sexuality that Protima, the scandalous model and wife of the rising star of Bollywood, Kabir Bedi, had lived ever since she ran away from home to live ‚Äòin sin‚Äô. Barely four years later, the glamorous flower child had reinvented herself as an accomplished classical dancer, a devotee of Goddess Kali, and chosen the sari over slit skirts and halter-necks Shortly before her death, she had shaved her head and decided on a monk‚Äôs life. She died in August 1998, in a landslide in the Himalayas while on a pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar, leaving behind her most lasting achievement‚Äïa flourishing dance village, Nrityagram, where students continue to learn the classical dance styles of India Few lives have been more eventful and controversial than Protima Bedi‚Äôs, and Timepass, derived from her unfinished autobiography, journals and her letters to family, friends and lovers, is a startlingly frank and passionate memoir. Protima recounts with unflinching honesty the events that shaped her life: her humiliation as a child at being branded the ugly duckling, repeated rape by a cousin when she was barely ten, the failure of her ‚Äòopen‚Äô marriage with Kabir Bedi, her many sexual encounters, and the romantic relationships she had with prominent politicians and artistes. She writes, too, of her involvement with dance, her relationship with her guru and fellow dancers, the difficult mission of establishing Nrityagram, and the suicide of her son‚Äïa tragedy from which she never fully recovered. In a moving afterword to the book, her daughter, Pooja Bedi, describes her last days and the circumstances of her death. Illustrated with over fifty photographs, Timepass is the story of a remarkable woman who had the spirit, the courage and the intelligence to live life entirely on her own terms."

Dr. Jalan has had a ringside view of financial governance during his long and distinguished career, which included stints as Union Finance Secretary and Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Drawing on this vast experience he compares two distinct periods: 1980‚Äì2000 and 2000‚Äì15, to examine the core changes and their significance and considers their lessons for the immediate future.

Dr Jalan suggests six critical issues where change can make a difference: revisit the anti-defection law so parties that join a coalition cannot defect without having to seek re-election; make the states‚Äîrather than the centre‚Äîresponsible for financial development programmes and poverty-alleviation schemes; establish rules to make Parliament‚Äôs proceedings orderly and purposeful; ensure a stable and competitive economic environment; make sure ministries are accountable for actual performance; and, finally, rationalize the system of delivery of public services to persons below the poverty line.

With such measures, India can become one of the fastest-growing emerging global powers and ensure that the benefits of such growth reach all her people."

Yet, Helen‚Äînicknamed ‚ÄòH-Bomb‚Äô at the height of her career‚Äîcontinues to rule the popular imagination. Improbably, for a dancer and a vamp, she has become an icon. Jerry Pinto‚Äôs gloriously readable book is a study of the phenomenon that was Helen: Why did a refugee of French-Burmese parentage succeed as wildly as she did in Bollywood? How could otherwise conservative families sit through, and even enjoy, her ‚Äòcabarets‚Äô? What made Helen ‚Äòthe desire that you need not be embarrassed about feeling‚Äô? How did she manage the unimaginable: vamp three generations of men on screen? Equally, the book is a wonderfully witty and provocative examination of middle-class Indian morality; the politics of religion, gender and sexuality in popular culture; and the importance of the song, the item-number and the wayward woman in Hindi cinema."

In this memoir by an unashamed Indian, Haksar writes about how food shaped her awareness of politics, patriarchy, nationalism and socialism, from her childhood during the Nehruvian era onwards. She takes us on a thoughtful journey through India, from her Kashmiri Pandit family settled in Old Delhi and Lucknow, to human-rights activism on behalf of Nagas in Manipur; from grappling with feminist ideals, to considering the impact of a globalized food industry in Goa.
On a wider scale, she explains how our tastes and attitudes to food are shaped by caste, race, gender and class, exposing latent prejudices and bigotry. Haksar explores questions posed by food anthropologists and ecologists and revisits debates between Babasaheb Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi on inter-dining. She also addresses the present controversies over beef-eating, vegetarianism and ideas of Hindu vs. Muslim food, in a milieu where debate is silenced.

With wry accounts of sharing meals with Burmese and Iraqi refugees and arguing about bourgeois vs. proletarian tea in the Naxalite movement, the book also contains memorable recipes from the many people she has eaten with. At heart is her question that if Indians cannot imagine sitting with each other and sharing food with a sense of equality and respect, how then can a national unity be built?"

Pawar identifies herself as a Dalit woman writer, a Buddhist, and a feministand all three identities reveal themselves powerfully in her stories. But the protagonists are not always Dalit, and the mood is not always one of anger, as Pawar eschews the stereotypes that attach themselves to the genre. Her harsh, sometimes vulgar, and always hard-hitting language subverts another stereotype: that of the soft-spoken woman writer.

A brilliant collection of stories from one of India¬ís foremost Dalit writers, Motherwit brings marginalized voices into the mainstream."

Having witnessed the evolution of the sport for over fifty years, Novy charts its eventful journey up to the present, to enthral old and new fans alike.

The issue of Kashmir still is a crucial issue discussed across forums in the global arena and is one of the major hindrances in improving relationship with India‚Äôs neighbour and kin of one time. Much has been written about Kashmir and the separatist movement in Kashmir. But the beautifully scripted account of the brutality with which the separatist movement is carried on till date has no precedence. The book, Curfewed Nights, gives an honest, crude, and truthful account of what goes on in the paradise of India which is under the spell of the separatist movement.
The author of the book, Basharat Peer, being a Kashmiri himself has related to each and every detail provided in the book from the first hand experiences gathered by him. Since independence of India, many Kashmiri youths have been mesmerised by the terrorism to the extent that they want to join the terrorist organisations even without thinking about their families or themselves. They have illusioned godfathers in the leaders of such terrorist outfits. In fact, the author was sent out of Kashmir by his family, just to keep him away from these painful romances with the militants.
The book, Curfewed Night, has a lot of heart rending accounts of how a mother watches her son who is forced to hold an exploding bomb or how a poet discovers his religion when his entire family is killed or how the politicians are tortured inside the refurbished torture chambers or how villages have been rigged with landmines which kills innocent civilians, and how temples have converted into army bunkers while ancient Sufi shrines have been decapitated in bomb blasts. This painful saga of humanity and human crucifiction in the name of religion and jihad was by RHI in the year 2009. The book is available in paperback."

Everyday life in contemporary rural India is characterized by an increased sense of mobility, inequality and uncertainty. Ordinary villagers often find themselves caught between the promises and failures of democracy and development. This ethnographic study of the village of Khanpur (in Uttar Pradesh, north India) is an attempt to grasp everyday life in rural India. Drawing on descriptions of village life, interspersed with theoretical analyses, the author examines how ordinary people construct their own sense of their lives and their futures in everyday activities: working on farms, attending college, searching for non-farm employment, celebrating religious rituals and dealing with local elections and democracy. The villagers confront growing economic and moral uncertainty; they creatively harmonize public discourse and local practice; and sometimes they resolve incoherence and unease through the use of irony. In so doing, they perform everyday village and caste ethics and re-create transient political, economic and moral communities at a time of massive social dislocation. Satendra Kumar in this lucid book shows, in no uncertain terms, that villages in Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere have been and continue to be vibrant grounds for the production of culture, sociality, hope, politics and persons. He also addresses anthropology's forfeiture of the village as a subject of study in an era of globalization."

A scientist and not a politician, with an unusual hairstyle and an unassuming way of doing things, and no other agenda except that of seeing India become a developed and strong nation. How would such a man fit into the regal splendour of Rashtrapati Bhavan, and all the pomp and ceremony of a head of state? What followed, however, as P.M. Nair shows in The Kalam Eff ect, was a remarkable presidency that in the next five years transformed the way people looked at this office, and made Kalam popular in a way few politicians have been. Rashtrapati Bhavan became a much more accessible place, and his 'at homes' drew guests in the thousands. Not only that, the website he set up became a huge draw, and people wrote to him on e-mail or otherwise from across the country. His positive attitude infected all those who came in touch with him. While the reasons for his popularity will be analysed for a long time, Nair, who was his Secretary, suggests in this affectionate yet factual account some of the probable causes.

A truly brilliant thriller by Tom Clancy, The Bear and the Dragon is a Jack Ryan novel.
Newly elected in his own right, Jack Ryan has found that being President has gotten no easier: domestic pitfalls await him at every turn; the Asian economy is going down the tubes; and now, in Moscow, someone may have tried to take out the chairman of the SVR - the former KGB - with a rocket-propelled grenade.

Ryan is right to wonder. For even while Russian investigators pursue the case, and some of his most trusted eyes and ears, including antiterrorism specialist John Clark, head to Moscow, forces in China are moving forward with a plan of truly audacious proportions. Tired of what they view as the presumption of the West, eager to fulfill their destiny, they are taking matters into their own hands.

Brave New World Revisited includes Huxley's views on overpopulation, propaganda, advertising and government control, and is an urgent and powerful appeal for the defence of individualism still alarmingly relevant today."

For several years of his turbulent life, Seneca was the guiding hand of the Roman Empire. His inspired reasoning derived mainly from the Stoic principles, which had originally been developed some centuries earlier in Athens. This selection of Seneca's letters shows him upholding the austere ethical ideals of Stoicism‚Äîthe wisdom of the self-possessed person immune to overmastering emotions and life‚Äôs setbacks‚Äîwhile valuing friendship and the courage of ordinary men, and criticizing the harsh treatment  of slaves and the cruelties in the gladiatorial arena. The humanity and wit revealed in Seneca‚Äôs interpretation of Stoicism is a moving and inspiring declaration of the dignity of the individual mind.

When Louis V. Gerstner became CEO of IBM in 1993, shares had slumped and the company was on the verge of collapse.

Within months of joining IBM, Gerstner presented his bold and controversial business strategy. Punitive towards office politics, he revolutionised the company from within, altering an entire corporate culture, divesting billions of dollars in unneeded assets and transforming IBM from a fractured, process-driven business into a nimble, customer-driven enterprise able to respond quickly to the volatile technology market and face down Microsoft and Intel in the internet era.

1649,Mas Oyamas's Complete Karate Course,Mas Oyama's,Martial Arts (Books),Sports,2.374748346,4.5,15,Paperback,2019,Apr,"Karate is currently enjoying wide popularity the world over. We encounter it frequently in books, films and on television. There are few people who have not seen a demonstration of brick or wood breaking or a single bare-handed man defeat a host of armed opponents. But karate is much more than this. It was developed over a thousand years ago, not only as a form of unarmed combat, but as a way to discipline the body in order to improve the spirit. In this way, a unity of body and spirit could be achieved.
If this sounds too abstract, perhaps we can use terms that are easier to deal with. Besides con¬≠ditioning the body and improving speed, strength and co-ordination, karate increases one's alertness and self-awareness. It also teaches confidence ¬≠not cockiness or brashness-but a deep confidence in one's abilities to deal with the world around him. And with confidence comes calmness and a sense of inner peace. This is the true karate, the karate that one can practice years after he can no longer break bricks. But everything must have- a beginning and great things cannot be accomplished in a handful of days. In karate, the beginning is the physical forms-the punches, kicks and blocks that we have all seen. These are the techniques that enable an adept karate to perform the seemingly impossible feats that he does.
Not everyone who studies karate achieves success, but if you are able to master the techniques described in this book, you could be one of them. Work with patience and perseverance and you are sure to find some measure of satisfaction. You must also work with caution, always bearing in mind that karate is a combat form and enables one to deliver a blow of devastating power. Techniques applied improperly or with insufficient care could cause injury to you or others.
May your pursuit of karate be a rewarding one."

Stephen Hawking, the great scientist and theoretical physicist, tries to answer it all by drawing theories of the entire cosmos from Albert Einstein to Newton. In doing so, he also sheds considerable light on the dark secrets that still reside at the heart of time and space.
This book takes the readers on a journey into the depth of cosmos right from the big bang theory, through the nature of forces and the world of string theory in physics, to the different forces that constitute the universe itself, summed up as the theory of everything.
Although a seemingly huge subject, Hawking tickles the mind of the inquisitive readers through his simple yet eloquent language of physics and mathematics and has even the non-scientific reader get attracted to the enormous universe and working of the cosmos.
By drawing analogies of Copernicus, Sagan, Kepler and Einstein, among others, who unfurled the science of universe to the common people, Stephen Hawking has yet managed to bring important topics wormholes and black holes into the discussion of common people.

But the thirteenth tablet is different. This tablet names the location to the mouth of hell itself.
And then Lily vanishes.
Has she walked out on her job, her marriage, and her life -- or has something more sinister happened? Her husband, Jonah, is desperate to find her.

3707,"The Doctor and the Saint: The Ambedkar‚ÄìGandhi Debate: Caste, Race, and Annihilation of Caste",Arundhati Roy,"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts (Books)","Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.31386722,3.9,12,Paperback,2019,Apr,"To best understand and address the inequality in India today, Arundhati Roy insists we must examine both the political development and influence of M.K. Gandhi and why B.R. Ambedkar's brilliant challenge to his near-divine status was suppressed by India's elite. In Roy's analysis, we see that Ambedkar's fight for justice was systematically sidelined in favor of policies that reinforced caste, resulting in the current nation of India: independent of British rule, globally powerful, and marked to this day by the caste system.
This book situates Ambedkar's arguments in their vital historical context-namely, as an extended public political debate with Mohandas Gandhi. 'For more than half a century-throughout his adult life-[Gandhi's] pronouncements on the inherent qualities of black Africans, untouchables and the laboring classes remained consistently insulting,' writes Roy. 'His refusal to allow working-class people and untouchables to create their own political organizations and elect their own representatives remained consistent too.'
In The Doctor and the Saint, Roy exposes some uncomfortable, controversial, and even surprising truths about the political thought and career of India's most famous and most revered figure. In doing so she makes the case for why Ambedkar's revolutionary intellectual achievements must be resurrected, not only in India but throughout the world."

He finally highlights the emergence of a new quality of cooperation between the Indian and the Armenian people at the end of the 20th century, which came as a result of the establishment of official ties between the newly independent Republic of Armenia and India on August 31, 1992, and presents his own inspirational vision for the future of this cooperation, based on his insights as a key player in its development.
The readers will be struck with the drastic contrast between the harmonious integration and prosperity of Armenians in Indian society in the past and the apparent absence of Armenians from the landscape of contemporary Indian culture, business and politics. The exodus of the erstwhile prosperous Armenian population from India was nothing but a misread of the situation and a miscalculation of the country's future on the part of Indian-Armenians in the 20th century.
India- Armenia: So Far Yet So Close is intended to trigger interest in its theme, help readers to visualize the distant past and introduce unfamiliar readers with the vibrant history shared between the two ancient people."

Dressed in a t-shirt and shorts, Ralston, a seasoned climber, figured he'd hike for a few hours and then head off to work. 40 miles from the nearest paved road, he found himself on top of an 800-pound boulder. As he slid down and off of the boulder it shifted, trapping his right hand against the canyon wall. No one knew where he was; he had little water; he wasn't dressed correctly; and the boulder wasn't going anywhere. He remained trapped for five days in the canyon: hypothermic at night, de-hydrated and hallucinating by day. Finally, he faced the most terrible decision of his life: braking the bones in his wrist by snapping them against the boulder, he hacked through the skin, and finally succeeded in amputating his right hand and wrist. The ordeal, however, was only beginning. He still faced a 60-foot rappell to freedom, and a walk of several hours back to his car - along the way, he miraculously met a family of hikers, and with his arms tourniqued, and blood-loss almost critical, they heard above them the whir of helicopter blades; just in time, Aron was rescued and rushed to hospital. Since that day, Aron has had a remarkable recovery. He is back out on the mountains, with an artificial limb; he speaks to select groups on his ordeal and rescue; and amazingly, he is upbeat, positive, and an inspiration to all who meet him. This is the account of those five days, of the years that led up to them, and where he goes from here. It is narrative non-fiction at its most compelling."

1521,And On That Bombshell: Inside the Madness and Genius of TOP GEAR,Richard Porter,Cinema & Broadcast (Books),Humour,2.285557309,5,5,Paperback,2016,Dec,"I was Top Gear's script editor for 13 years and all 22 series. I basically used to check spelling and think of stupid gags about The Stig. I also got to hang around with Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May. It didn't feel like something you should get paid for.

From the disastrous pilot show of 2002 to the sudden and unexpected ending in 2015, working on Top Gear was quite a rollercoaster ride. We crossed continents, we made space ships, we bobbed across the world's busiest shipping lane in a pick-up truck. We also got chased by an angry mob, repeatedly sparked fury in newspapers, and almost killed one of our presenters.

I realised that I had quite a few stories to tell from behind the scenes on the show. I remembered whose daft idea it was to get a dog. I recalled the willfully stupid way in which we decorated our horrible office. I had a sudden flashback to the time a Bolivian drug lord threatened to kill us. I decided I should write down some of these stories. So I have. I hope you like them.

And now, a quote from James May: 'Richard Porter has asked me to ""write a quote"" for his new book about the ancient history of Top Gear. But this is a ridiculous request. How can one ""write a quote""? Surely, by definition, a quote must be extracted from a greater body of writing, for the purpose of illustrating or supporting a point in an unrelated work. I cannot ""write a quote"" any more than I could ""film an out-take"".

""Listen. The Sanctuary of the Redeemers on Shotover Scarp is named after a damned lie for there is no redemption that goes on there and less sanctuary.""
The Sanctuary of the Redeemers is a vast and desolate place - a place without joy or hope. Most of its occupants were taken there as boys and for years have endured the brutal regime of the Lord Redeemers whose cruelty and violence have one singular purpose - to serve in the name of the One True Faith.
In one of the Sanctuary's vast and twisting maze of corridors stands a boy. He is perhaps fourteen or fifteen years old - he is not sure and neither is anyone else. He has long-forgotten his real name, but now they call him Thomas Cale. He is strange and secretive, witty and charming, violent and profoundly bloody-minded. He is so used to the cruelty that he seems immune, but soon he will open the wrong door at the wrong time and witness an act so terrible that he will have to leave this place, or die.
His only hope of survival is to escape across the arid Scablands to Memphis, a city the opposite of the Sanctuary in every way: breathtakingly beautiful, infinitely Godless, and deeply corrupt.
But the Redeemers want Cale back at any price... not because of the secret he now knows but because of a much more terrifying secret he does not.
The Left Hand of God is a must read. It is the first instalment in a gripping trilogy by Paul Hoffman. Imagine if Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials met Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose. Fans of epic heroic fiction will love this series.

Timi gave birth to animals who swim
Vinata gave birth to animals who fly
Kadru gave birth to animals who crawl
Surabhi gave birth to animals with hooves
Sarama gave birth to animals with paws
Surasa gave birth to animals who defy classification
This book retells their stories. With over 75 gorgeously illustrated anecdotes, Devdutt Pattanaik reveals how our ancestors imagined the animal kingdom and the key role animals played in human lives.

2388,Introducing Foucault: A Graphic Guide,Chris Horrocks,Anthropology (Books),Comics & Mangas,2.255272505,4.4,2,Paperback,2009,Jun,"Michel Foucault's work was described at his death as 'the most important event of thought in our century'. As a philosopher, historian and political activist, he certainly left behind an enduring and influential body of work, but is this acclaim justified? ""Introducing Foucault"" places his work in its turbulent philosophical and political context, and critically explores his mission to expose the links between knowledge and power in the human sciences, their discourses and institutions. This book explains how Foucault overturned our assumptions about the experience and perception of madness, sexuality and criminality, and the often brutal social practices of confinement, confession and discipline. It also describes Foucault's engagement with psychiatry and clinical medicine, his political activism and the transgressive aspects of pleasure and desire that he promoted in his writing."

Saadat Hasan Manto, one of the greatest short story writers of the Urdu language, was also a film journalist and story-writer for the Hindi film industry in Bombay. As an insider he was privy to the most private moments of the men and women who have dazzled generations of audiences. In this series of sketches, Ashok Kumar, the screen idol of yore, emerges as a shy, yet brilliant actor, forever looking to flee the eager advances of his female fans; Nargis comes across as just another young girl looking for companionship among her peers before she steps on the ladder that will forever take her away from the comforts of an ordinary middle-class life; and Shyam‚Äîthe dashing, handsome hero‚Äîis portrayed as a straightforward, flirtatious young man pining for the woman he loves. Manto also describes in detail the obsessions of Sitara Devi; the unfulfilled desires of Paro Devi; and the intriguing twists and turns which transform Neena Devi from an ordinary housewife into a pawn in the hands of film companies. He writes with relish about the bunglings of the comedian V.H. Desai and the incredible dedication of Nawab Kaashmiri to the art of acting. There are also stories about the rise of Nur Jehan as the greatest singer of her times; and the various peccadilloes of the musician, Rafiq Ghaznavi.

History of the world is replete with such instances of such men and women who went against all the odds and achieved great heights and changed the shape of the world. In fact, reading about the life-sketch of a scientist and his achievements, has certainly great infotainment value. Besides, the lives of great men and women provide us inspiration to do things differently and more confidently. For some people these inspirations have more importance than any other motivational factors. When we learn that Edison was a poor boy without any formal schooling or Faraday was an apprentice at a stationery shop we feel greatly motivated and think, 'if they could do it we can do it too!'. We find a new confidence in ourselves. In this respect the importance of these books, specially for children, can hardly be underestimated. Rather they could even be a part of the curriculum-- as at times they can prove so inspiring and motivate a person in such a way, that they could change the entire course of the life of a person. The main aim of this series is to expand the mental horizons of our readers and motivate them to achieve great heights in life. It is certainly a very valuable addition to the literature of popular science. The book can also prove to be an ideal companion during leisure time."

'The Story of My Experiments with Truth‚Äô is the compelling autobiography of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who in his quest for freedom of his country, inspired millions with the strength of his willpower and personal actions. His immovable belief in truth and non-violence even in the most difficult situations made him a true hero. India has seen many heroes rise and sacrifice themselves for the greater good, but rarely has there been a man as great and as noble as Mahatma Gandhi who captured the imagination of the whole world. He is a 'Maha-atma' in the truest sense of the word. The book traces the unordinary journey of an ordinary man who became one of the main pillars of the Indian independence movement. There has never been a biography so honest in its attempt. One of the major assets of the book is that it has been writing in an easy to understand language.
The book is an overall account of his long journey wherein he had to deal with travesties and social issues using his ideology of truth, will power, self-discipline, honesty, his understanding of Satyagraha and his lifestyle of vegetarianism. The most amiable aspect of this book is that not once does Gandhi try to over emphasize his achievements and victories. His humble nature shines throughout and his belief in God is unshakable. Trust, according to him, is the reward for all of his great achievements. This autobiography is truly the mark of a great mind. Anyone who bases their ideologies on Gandhi can cause a significant change in his/her life for the better. Gandhi depicts honest records of his own internal psychological and personal struggles.
About the author

Following his ideals of non-violence and Satyagraha, Gandhiji (Bapu) held firm thanks to his beliefs and ideologies surpassing a wide array of subjects like religion, politics, parenting and sex education.

This is followed by Chinese characters, known as Hanzi. The Hanzi used in this book are the simplified characters of China. Meaning of each Chinese character is given under it in English. If you have difficulty in pronouncing a Chinese word or phrase, you can point to the accompanying Hanzi and ask the Chinese with whom you wish to communicate to read it.
In pinyin, I have given tones as they are listed in. the dictionary. In the introduction, I have explained how tone of some words depend on the tone of the word following; so while speaking Chinese, do keep in mind this change in tones.

5071,Man's Search for Meaning,Viktor E Frankl,Psychology (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.178976947,4.3,800,Paperback,2008,Feb,"Man's Search for Meaning was first published in 1946. Victor Frankl was a leading psychologist in Vienna when he was arrested for being a Jew during the Nazi regime. He survived holocaust and used his experiences to write this book. He propounded the theory that it is Man's constant search for meaning that allows him to survive even the most brutal, the most degrading situations in his life.
He said there are only two races in the world, the decent and indecent. They will maintain their innate beliefs, no matter which side they are on. The decent ones will try to help the fellow human beings and the indecent ones will be selfish and serve themselves at the cost to the others.
Frankl's views were different from those of the leading psychologist of his times, Freud and Adler. His research was intensely personal and unique. His findings of human behaviour were based on the most extenuating circumstances that humans face. He suffered holocaust along with several other inmates and he observed their behaviour closely. He found that those with a capability to focus on love were the ones that survived. He based this observation on a long walk he was forced into by his captors. His companion spoke about his wife. This made Frankl think about his wife and the thought of her took his mind away from his current agony of being hit with rifle butts by his captors for dawdling.
The book has been listed as one of the 10 most influential books. It has a message of hope that has continued to inspire readers down the years.
About the author:
Victor Emile Frankl was a successful neurologist and psychologist dedicated to saving people from suicidal depression. He was born into a Jewish family because of which he was prosecuted by the Nazi regime after they took over Austria. He was banished to Nazi Theresienstadt Ghetto along with his family in 1942. He continued to practice as a Psychologist there and continued to treat people with depression. He was sent to Auschwitz in 1944 where he spent several months before they were liberated in 1945. He watched his family die in concentration camps.
He used his experiences as a holocaust survivor in his bestselling book Man's search for meaning. He worked at the Vienna Polyclinic for Neurology. He lectured extensively and conducted seminars all over the world. He lectured at the University of Vienna and Harvard. He wrote 39 books which were translated in several languages. He died of heart failure in 1997."

3093,Final Test: Exit Sachin Tendulkar,Dilip D'souza,Cricket (Books),Sports,2.178976947,3.6,6,Paperback,2014,Nov,"The deafening noise in the Wankhede turns to silence so complete that you'd swear you can hear Tendulkar's footsteps as he begins the walk back to the pavilion. It's the end of an era, they said. No more switching off televisions when he got out, no more resounding chants of 'Sa-chi-i-i-n, Sa-chin!' In November 2013, Sachin Tendulkar played his final Test.
Dilip D'Souza builds on close and detailed observation of those two and a half days, capturing all the hysteria it spawned, the love and adulation that showered from the rafters at the Wankhede, the choking emotion and yes, there was a match on too, against the West Indies. Final Test discusses cricket from the old to the new, as Sachin takes to the pitch one final time.
Quote:
'A compelling and different, read of a Test match that stopped the nation.' Rahul Dravid
Foreword by Harsha Bhogle
'Through a close scrutiny of Tendulkar's last Test - of the cricket but also of the swell and fall of emotions around him - D'Souza teases out the larger issues that plague the game, in India as well as overseas. His refreshing honesty and outspokenness puncture the bubble that has often enveloped both Tendulkar and cricket in this country.' - Samanth Subramanian"
5537,The Impatient Optimist : Bill Gates In His Own Words,Lisa Edited by Rogak,Biographies & Autobiographies (Books),"Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts",2.178976947,3,70,Paperback,2012,Sep,"Bill Gates, the founder and former CEO of Microsoft, has been a revered, and occasionally controversial, worldwide business icon for more than three decades.
Recognized by most as an ingenious visionary, and painted by some as a tyrannical, less-than-scrupulous empire builder, Gates has had an unignorable impact on the growth of digital technology in daily life over the past 30 years. Even his sharpest critics have to acknowledge the obvious: Gates helped spearhead one of the greatest revolutions in modern history by seizing on the importance of software to the rise of the personal computer, along the way turning an arcane, specialized technology into a commonplace tool for the office and home.
Gates has long been ranked as one of the world‚Äôs wealthiest men--which gave him a name recognition far greater than that of most CEOs--and businesspeople of all stripes have looked to him as a role model, using his words and business strategies to help create, inspire, and grow their own companies. After he stopped running Microsoft's day-to-day operations in 2008 to devote himself full-time to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a kinder, gentler Gates began to emerge. As a result, people actively involved in the philanthropic world, whether in professional, part-time, or personal capacities, began to develop a new appreciation for the man.
Bill Gates‚Äôs second act is no less compelling than his first. And whether you‚Äôre interested in his personal life or looking for inspiration to drive you forward in your own business endeavors, Impatient Optimist: Bill Gates in His Own Words has much to offer. As the tech giants who distinguished the turn of the 21st century shape public life in ways that outstrip the efforts of the previous century's titans of industry, we look to figures like Gates for inspiration as one of America's greatest business icons. This book will surely feed the world's curiosity about one of the most important leaders of the digital age."

These seven stories represent Mann‚Äôs early writing career and a level of literary quality Mann himself despaired of ever again matching.

Writing with characteristic humility and humour, Hawking opens up about the challenges that confronted him following his diagnosis of motor neurone disease aged twenty-one. Tracing his development as a thinker, he explains how the prospect of an early death urged him onwards through numerous intellectual breakthroughs, and talks about the genesis of his masterpiece A Brief History of Time ‚Äì one of the iconic books of the twentieth century.

Clear-eyed, intimate and wise, My Brief History opens a window for the rest of us into Hawking‚Äôs personal cosmos.

1362,Oprah: A Biography,Kitty Kelley,Biographies & Autobiographies (Books),Humour,2,4,1,Mass Market Paperback,2011,Mar,"For the past twenty-five years, no one has been better at revealing secrets than Oprah Winfrey. On what is arguably the most influential show in television history, she has gotten her guests‚Äîoften the biggest celebrities in the world‚Äîto bare their love lives, explore their painful pasts, admit their transgressions, reveal their pleasures, and explore their demons. In turn, Oprah has repeatedly allowed her audience to share in her own life story, opening up about the sexual abuse in her past and discussing her romantic relationships, her weight problems, her spiritual beliefs, her charitable donations, and her strongly held views on the state of the world.

After a quarter of a century of the Oprah-ization of America, can there be any more secrets left to reveal?

Yes. Because Oprah has met her match.

Kitty Kelley has, over the same period of time, fear¬¨lessly and relentlessly investigated and written about the world‚Äôs most revered icons: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Frank Sinatra, Nancy Reagan, England‚Äôs Royal Family, and the Bush dynasty. In her #1 bestselling biographies, she has exposed truths and exploded myths to uncover the real human beings that exist behind their manufac¬¨tured facades.

Turning her reportorial sights on Oprah, Kelley has now given us an unvarnished look at the stories Oprah‚Äôs told and the life she‚Äôs led. Kelley has talked to Oprah‚Äôs closest family members and business associates. She has obtained court records, birth certificates, financial and tax records, and even copies of Oprah‚Äôs legendary (and punishing) confidentiality agreements. She has probed every aspect of Oprah Winfrey‚Äôs life, and it is as if she‚Äôs written the most extraordinary segment of The Oprah Winfrey Show ever filmed‚Äîone in which Oprah herself is finally and fully revealed.

There is a case to be made, and it is certainly made in this book, that Oprah Winfrey is an important, and even great, figure of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. But there is also a case to be made that even greatness needs to be examined and put under a microscope. Fact must be separated from myth, truth from hype. Kitty Kelley has made that separation, showing both sides of Oprah as they have never been shown before. In doing so she has written a psychologically perceptive and meticulously researched book that will surprise and thrill everyone who reads it."

Gitanjali is poetry of life-affirmation: life with its colour and abundance, melancholy and mystery. It is a record of the poet‚Äôs intimate response to the splendour of the universe. His poetry in translation was viewed as spiritual, and this together with his mesmerizing persona gave him a prophet-like aura in the west but his ‚Äúelegant prose and magical poetry‚Äù still remains largely unknown outside the confines of Bengal."

3320,Pitman Shorthand Instructor and Key,Issac Pitman,Language Learning & Teaching (Books),"Language, Linguistics & Writing",1.968482949,4.3,123,Paperback,2003,None,"This book provides the readers with instructions on shorthand. It has been written by Isaac Pitman, and is one of the most selling books on the art of shorthand.
Shorthand can be defined as the art of symbolically representing sounds with the help of characters. It was Sir Isaac Pitman who invented the shorthand in 1836. It is a diverse and well-styled system that has been updated and revised many times since it was first introduced.
The result has been a system that meets the practical needs of our age and can be implemented on all stylesof shorthand writing. The main feature of this book is the fact that it is very simple and primarily phonetic. The author has written down the sounds and not necessarily the letters.
Readers will find that the sound-made-vowels are represented with the help of dashes and dots. Other sounds are represented by shapes that have been placed next to stokes, which are main. This innovative system saves times and displays a clear sound for the consonant.
The rules for various sounds have been clearly mentioned in the book. The placement of stokes will either be above the word or below it. There are other sounds which are represented by making the strokes double or by cutting them into half. The book has been divided into clear chapters, which make reading and understanding this seemingly difficult and different subject very easy.
The book is very helpful to those who are interested in undertaking secretarial profiles in the future and others who are interested in professions related to writing in the English language.
About the Author
Isaac Pitman was an Englishman who was known for developing the most widely used system-of-shorthand known as the Pitman shorthand. He had first suggested this in Stenographic Soundhand. He was an experienced teacher and taught at a private school. He was the Vegetarian Society's vice-president as well and was knighted in 1894."

We have therefore, touched upon his early life and the influence of his great master upon him. There has never been a more fascinating story of a guru and disciple. The guru Sri Ramkrishna was a divinity in flesh and blood. There should not be the least doubt about that. But doubts are intrinsic to human nature. Even the great disciple Swami Vivekananda had a lingering doubt, perhaps as a brief flash of thought as to whether his master was really a divine incarnate, a Paramhamsa or not. The inside pages contain an interesting and elevating story of how a westernized disciple, who believed in logic and reasoning and whose intellect was superlative with strong will power came gradually to believe in the Vedantic dictum of divine unity through the grace of his guru."
